Conditioning is More Than Association Formation: On the Different Ways in Which Conditioning Research is Valuable for Clinical Psychology,2020,Perspective/opinion,6,1,10.1525/collabra.239,"Cognitively-oriented clinical psychologists sometimes think of conditioning as the formation of associations in memory. From this perspective, conditioning research is important because it reveals the conditions under which potentially pathogenic associations are formed and can be changed. In this paper, I point out that it is also possible and useful to think of conditioning in ways that do not refer to associations. First, based on the idea that conditioning effects are due to the formation of propositional beliefs, it is possible to appreciate that conditioning research informs us about one way of forming or revising beliefs: via the experience of events. Second, conditioning research reveals the environmental causes of behavior and behavior change and thus has merit regardless of ideas about the cognitive processes and representations that mediate conditioning. By discussing these different perspectives on conditioning as well as the way in which they are related, I hope to provide the reader with a wider appreciation of the merits of conditioning research for clinical psychology.","conditioning, clinical psychology, psychotherapy, levels of explanation, learning",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.239/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.239/galley/337/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.239.pr,The author has no competing interests to declare.,"Jan De Houwer, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

Implicit Preferences for Straight People over Lesbian Women and Gay Men Weakened from 2006 to 2013,2015,Original research report,1,1,10.1525/collabra.18,"Legal rights and cultural attitudes towards lesbian women and gay men have shifted rapidly in the early 21st century. Using 683,976 visitors to Project Implicit from February 2006 to August 2013, we investigated whether shifts were also observable in implicit evaluations that occur outside of conscious awareness or control. Similar to public opinion polling, the estimated explicit preference for straight people over lesbian women and gay men was 26% weaker on the last day compared to the first. The estimated implicit preference for straight people declined by 13.4% over the same period. The largest shifts in implicit evaluations occurred among Hispanic, White, female, liberal, and young adult participants; the smallest shifts occurred among Black, Asian, male, conservative, and older adult participants. Societal change in evaluation of lesbian and gay people is not limited to what people are willing and able to report. However, change in implicit evaluation appears to be slower.","Implicit Association Test, culture, social psychology, implicit social cognition, sexual orientation",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.18/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.18/galley/2/download/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18.opr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8401,711,47.668,12450620
"Recalling Experiences: Looking at Momentary, Retrospective and Global Assessments of Relationship Satisfaction",2020,Original research report,6,1,10.1525/collabra.278,"Relationship satisfaction can be assessed in retrospection, as a global evaluation, or as a momentary state. In two experience sampling studies (N = 130, N = 510) the specificities of these assessment modalities are examined. We show that 1) compared to other summary statistics like the median, the mean of relationship satisfaction states describes retrospective and global evaluations best (but the difference to some other summary statistics was negligible); 2) retrospection introduces an overestimation of the average annoyance in the relationship reported on a momentary basis, which results in an overall negative mean-level bias for retrospective relationship satisfaction; 3) this bias is most strongly moderated by global relationship satisfaction at the time of retrospection; 4) snapshots of momentary relationship satisfaction get representative of global evaluations after approximately two weeks of sampling. The findings extend the recall bias reported in the literature for retrospection of negative affect to the domain of relationship evaluations and assist researchers in designing efficient experience sampling studies.","romantic relationships, relationship satisfaction, retrospection, recall, experience sampling method",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.278/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.278/galley/347/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.278.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"The authors thank Birk Hagemeyer, Sebastian Pusch, Paula Fehrmann, Nicole Horn, and Lara Lietge for the PACT scoring, Helen Baumann for assistance during data collection of Study 1, as well as Tobias Kächele, Lukas Müller and Ludwig Zellner for the app development.","The data of both studies are available as a scientific use file (Zygar et al., 2018b for Study 1; Zygar-Hoffmann, Hagemeyer, Pusch, & Schönbrodt, 2020 for Study 2).

Group Influences on Children’s Delay of Gratification: Testing the Roles of Culture and Personal Connections,2020,Original research report,6,1,10.1525/collabra.265,"Delaying gratification can be difficult, especially for children. Social factors such as group norms influence whether children delay gratification and may shape their life trajectories. However, such influences have been tested experimentally only in American contexts and may not generalize, given differences among cultures in personal connections and group dynamics. We tested the influences of groups and personal connections on delaying gratification in 106 Japanese preschoolers. Extending previous findings with American preschoolers, Japanese children also delayed gratification and valued delaying gratification more if they believed that their group delayed gratification (and an outgroup did not) than if they believed that their group did not delay gratification (and an outgroup did). Group identity shifted toward the outgroup when Japanese children had a personal connection to the outgroup, but they nonetheless followed the behavior of their ingroup in delaying gratification. These findings highlight similarities and potential differences in social influences across cultures, and underscore the importance of cross-cultural work for theories of development.","self-control, executive function, social influences, cognitive development, open data, open materials, preregistered, culture, group identity",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.265/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.265/galley/335/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.265.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"We thank the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Kyoto University, and the University of Colorado Boulder for supporting the sabbatical of the first author and this research project; the children and families of the Kindergarten School Attached to Wakayama Shin-ai Women’s Junior College for their participation; Viola Macchi Cassia and Kang Lee for sharing face stimuli used in this work; Yusuke Moriguchi, Shoji Itakura, and members of the Memory Discussion Meeting and Cognitive Development Center for helpful discussions.","The stimuli used in the study are restricted use; thus, we are not able to share them on the OSF page.

Processing the Word Red and Intellectual Performance: Four Replication Attempts,2020,Original research report,6,1,10.1525/collabra.277,"Colors convey meaning and can impair intellectual performance in achievement situations. Even the processing of color words can exert similar detrimental effects. In four experiments, we tried to replicate previous findings regarding the processing of the word “red” (as compared to a control color) on cognitive test scores. Experiments 1 and 2 (Ns = 69 and 104) are direct replications of Lichtenfeld, Maier, Elliot, and Pekrun (2009). Both experiments failed to uncover a red color effect on verbal reasoning scores among high school students and undergraduates (Cohen’s d = 0.04 and –0.23). Experiments 3 and 4 (N = 103 and 1,149) failed to identify an effect of processing red on general knowledge test scores (Cohen’s d = 0.19) and 0.01) among undergraduates and adults.

Why Self-Report Measures of Self-Control and Inhibition Tasks Do Not Substantially Correlate,2020,Perspective/opinion,6,1,10.1525/collabra.276,"Trait self-control is often defined as the ability to inhibit dominant responses including thoughts, emotions, and behavioral impulses. Despite the pivotal role of inhibition for trait self-control, a growing body of evidence found small-to-zero correlations between self-report measures of trait self-control and behavioral inhibition tasks. These observations seem puzzling considering that both types of measures are often seen as operationalizations of the same or at least closely related theoretical constructs. Previous explanations for this non-correspondence focused on psychometric properties of the measures. Here, we discuss three further factors that may explain the empirical non-correspondence between trait self-control scales and behavioral inhibition tasks: (1) the distinction between typical and maximum performance, (2) the measurement of single versus repeated performance, and (3) differences between impulses in different domains. Specifically, we argue that a) self-report measures of trait self-control are designed to assess typical performance, and relative to these, behavioral inhibition tasks are designed to assess maximum performance; b) self-report measures of trait self-control capture central tendencies of aggregates of many different instances of behavior, whereas behavioral inhibition tasks are momentary, one-time state measures; and c) most self-report measures of trait self-control are designed to measure general, cross-domain inhibition, whereas behavioral inhibition tasks also measure narrower, domain-specific inhibition to a substantial degree. In conclusion, we argue that it is implausible to hypothesize more than a low correlation between self-report measures of trait self-control and behavioral inhibition tasks as they genuinely focus on different aspects of the theoretical construct of self-control. We also discuss the broader implications of these issues for self-control as a theoretical construct and its appropriate measurement.","self-control, self-report measures, Self-Control Scale, inhibition tasks, executive function, typical versus maximum performance, impulses",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.276/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.276/galley/351/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.276.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"The authors thank Blair Saunders, an anonymous reviewer, and the handling editor Simine Vazire for stimulating comments and fruitful advice on how to improve and expand this manuscript.",NA,NA,NA,LW and MF conceived the manuscript.

Under What Conditions Does Prosocial Spending Promote Happiness?,2020,Original research report,6,1,10.1525/collabra.254,"Under what conditions does prosocial spending promote happiness? In a series of appropriately powered and pre-registered experiments, the present research revisited the role of impact, social connection, and perceived choice in maximizing the emotional benefits of spending money on others. In two exploratory studies, we found that happy (vs. less happy) prosocial spending experiences were marked by higher levels of impact, social connection and perceived choice (Study 1a and 1b). Consistent with these initial findings, three pre-registered studies confirmed that spending money on others was particularly rewarding when people were able to see the difference their generosity made (Study 2); when they felt a sense of social connection to the person or cause they were helping (Study 3); and when they felt that the decision to help was freely chosen (Study 4). Together, our findings corroborate previous research on impact, social connection and perceived choice, and highlight the importance of considering these key variables when evaluating old and new evidence on the emotional benefits of prosocial spending. In addition, our findings suggest that charitable organizations and policymakers should review their current solicitation strategies and pay more attention to people’s sense of impact, connection and choice when seeking charitable donations.","well-being, happiness, prosocial spending, prosocial behaviour, self-determination theory",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.254/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.254/galley/343/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.254.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,We would like to thank Zoey Gray for her instrumental help in conducting this research.,"All data, materials and program syntax can be found on OSF.

We used a large (N = 515) online sample to replicate the findings that inattentional blindness increases with age and with the distance of the unexpected object from the focus of attention.

What are Replicable Aspects of the Broader Autism Phenotype among College Students?,2020,Original research report,6,1,10.1525/collabra.271,"Are people with heightened autistic traits less likely to help other people? Recent research suggests that heightened autistic traits are associated with reduced self-reported prosocial behavior among college students. However, the growing literature examining sub-clinical traits associated with autism, or the Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP), among college students has invested insufficient attention in replication of findings, potential interrelationships between constructs, or the degree to which social desirability bias may contribute to findings. To identify replicable aspects of the BAP, we administered a battery of measures to 391 undergraduate students. Replicating prior work, findings suggested that self-reported difficulties understanding the self and others (but not less feeling for others) and sensory atypicalities are core aspects of the BAP. Reduced social desirability bias was also associated with the BAP. Prior associations between reduced prosocial tendencies and the BAP were not replicated. Findings highlight the importance of assessing multiple potential aspects of the BAP, particularly reduced susceptibility to the social desirability bias, when using self-report measures.","Broader Autism Phenotype, prosocial, Theory of Mind, alexithymia, social desirability bias, sensory processing",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.271/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.271/galley/345/download/,NA,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,All data were processed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26.

Journal Data Sharing Policies and Statistical Reporting Inconsistencies in Psychology,2017,Original research report,3,1,10.1525/collabra.102,"In this paper, we present three retrospective observational studies that investigate the relation between data sharing and statistical reporting inconsistencies. Previous research found that reluctance to share data was related to a higher prevalence of statistical errors, often in the direction of statistical significance (Wicherts, Bakker, & Molenaar, 2011). We therefore hypothesized that journal policies about data sharing and data sharing itself would reduce these inconsistencies. In Study 1, we compared the prevalence of reporting inconsistencies in two similar journals on decision making with different data sharing policies. In Study 2, we compared reporting inconsistencies in psychology articles published in PLOS journals (with a data sharing policy) and Frontiers in Psychology (without a stipulated data sharing policy). In Study 3, we looked at papers published in the journal Psychological Science to check whether papers with or without an Open Practice Badge differed in the prevalence of reporting errors. Overall, we found no relationship between data sharing and reporting inconsistencies. We did find that journal policies on data sharing seem extremely effective in promoting data sharing. We argue that open data is essential in improving the quality of psychological science, and we discuss ways to detect and reduce reporting inconsistencies in the literature.","Statistical errors, data sharing, journal policy, meta-research",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.102/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.102/galley/132/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.102.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"We would like to thank Sofie Swaans and Elise Crompvoets for their assistance in coding the articles for open data.

"The Interplay between Subjectivity, Statistical Practice, and Psychological Science",2016,Review article,2,1,10.1525/collabra.28,"Bayesian inference has been advocated as an alternative to conventional analysis in psychological science. Bayesians stress that subjectivity is needed for principled inference, and subjectivity by-and-large has not been seen as desirable. This paper provides the broader rationale and context for subjectivity, and in it we show that subjectivity is the key to principled measures of evidence for theory from data. By making our subjective elements focal, we provide an avenue for common sense and expertise to enter the analysis. We cover the role of models in linking theory to data, the notion that models are abstractions which are neither true nor false, the need for relative model comparison, the role of predictions in stating relative evidence for models, and the role of subjectivity in specifying models that yield predictions. In the end, we conclude that transparent subjectivity leads to a more honest and fruitful analyses in psychological science.","Inference, model selection, Bayesian analysis, Bayes factors",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.28/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.28/galley/23/download/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/collabra.28.opr,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2919,553,16.25,13560184
Response Time Concealed Information Test on Smartphones,2020,Original research report,6,1,10.1525/collabra.255,"The Response Time-Based Concealed Information Test (RT-CIT) can reveal when a person recognizes a relevant (probe) item among other, irrelevant items, based on comparatively slower responding to the probe item. Thereby, if a person is concealing the knowledge about the relevance of this item (e.g., recognizing it as a murder weapon), this deception can be revealed. So far, the RT-CIT has been used only on desktop computers. In Experiment 1 (n = 72; within-subject), we compare the probe-irrelevant differences when using the conventional desktop-based CIT to using a smartphone-based CIT, demonstrating practical equivalence. In Experiment 2 (n = 116; within-subject), we demonstrate that using thumbs for responses (while holding the smartphone) leads to equally efficient CIT results as using conventional index finger responses. At the same time, this second experiment also demonstrates how smartphone-based studies may be efficiently run in large groups, using the participants’ own smartphones. Finally, as an interesting addition, here for the first time we also measured keypress durations (i.e., the time durations of holding down the response keys) in the RT-CIT, which we found to be significantly shorter for probe than for irrelevant items.","deception, concealed information test, response time, smartphone, mobile",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.255/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.255/galley/341/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.255.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"The source codes for all three experimental tasks, along with all behavioral data (original as well as aggregated per participant) and the R scripts for the analyses, are available via https://osf.io/fjvna/.

The Effect of Concrete Wording on Truth Judgements: A Preregistered Replication and Extension of Hansen & Wänke (2010),2019,Registered report,5,1,10.1525/collabra.192,"When you lack the facts, how do you decide what is true and what is not? In the absence of knowledge, we sometimes rely on non-probative information. For example, participants judge concretely worded trivia items as more likely to be true than abstractly worded ones (the linguistic truth effect; Hansen & Wänke, 2010). If minor language differences affect truth judgements, ultimately they could influence more consequential political, legal, health, and interpersonal choices. This Registered Report includes two high-powered replication attempts of Experiment 1 from Hansen and Wänke (2010). Experiment 1a was a dual-site, in-person replication of the linguistic concreteness effect in the original paper-and-pencil format (n = 253, n = 246 in analyses). Experiment 1b replicated the study with an online sample (n = 237, n = 220 in analyses).

Improving Human Interaction Research through Ecological Grounding,2018,Perspective/opinion,4,1,10.1525/collabra.132,"In psychology, we tend to follow the general logic of falsificationism: we separate the ‘context of discovery’ (how we come up with theories) from the ‘context of justification’ (how we test them). However, when studying human interaction, separating these contexts can lead to theories with low ecological validity that do not generalize well to life outside the lab. We propose borrowing research procedures from well-established inductive methodologies in interaction research during the process of discovering new regularities and analyzing natural data without being led by theory. We introduce research procedures including the use of naturalistic study settings, analytic transcription, collections of cases, and data analysis sessions, and illustrate these with examples from a successful cross-disciplinary study. We argue that if these procedures are used systematically and transparently throughout a research cycle, they will lead to more robust and ecologically valid theories about interaction within psychology and, with some adaptation, can enhance the reproducibility of research across many other areas of psychological science.","experimental psychology, conversation analysis, methodology, interaction",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.132/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.132/galley/180/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.132.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Drafted and/or revised the article: SA, JDR.

A New Replication Norm for Psychology,2015,Original research report,1,1,10.1525/collabra.23,"In recent years, there has been a growing concern regarding the replicability of findings in psychology, including a mounting number of prominent findings that have failed to replicate via high-powered independent replication attempts. In the face of this replicability “crisis of confidence”, several initiatives have been implemented to increase the reliability of empirical findings. In the current article, I propose a new replication norm that aims to further boost the dependability of findings in psychology. Paralleling the extant social norm that researchers should peer review about three times as many articles that they themselves publish per year, the new replication norm states that researchers should aim to independently replicate important findings in their own research areas in proportion to the number of original studies they themselves publish per year (e.g., a 4:1 original-to-replication studies ratio). I argue this simple approach could significantly advance our science by increasing the reliability and cumulative nature of our empirical knowledge base, accelerating our theoretical understanding of psychological phenomena, instilling a focus on quality rather than quantity, and by facilitating our transformation toward a research culture where executing and reporting independent direct replications is viewed as an ordinary part of the research process. To help promote the new norm, I delineate (1) how each of the major constituencies of the research process (i.e., funders, journals, professional societies, departments, and individual researchers) can incentivize replications and promote the new norm and (2) any obstacles each constituency faces in supporting the new norm.","Independent replication, cumulative knowledge, replication norm",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.23/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.23/galley/10/download/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/collabra.23.opr,The author declares that they have no competing interests.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2244,412,9.95,12510237

Study 1 shows narrative format improves stigma toward Syrian refugees indirectly through narrative engagement, perceived similarity, and meaningful affect. Decreases in stigma also improved attitudes toward refugees. Study 2 replicates these findings against a separate participant pool, an additional story topic, and compares changes in engagement, stigma, and attitude to a non-narrative fact sheet and a control condition. A preregistered third study seeks to validate the finding that narratives can elicit destigmatization and disentangle the roles of story exemplars from story structure.","Narrative persuasion, refugees, stigma, attitude, journalism",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.172/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.172/galley/319/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.172.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"All the stimuli, presentation materials, participant data, and analysis scripts can be found on this paper’s project page on the OSF (osf.io/y6vt2).",osf.io/y6vt2,NA,"Contributed to conception and design: DT Contributed to acquisition of data: DT, JH Contributed to analysis and interpretation of data: DT Drafted and/or revised the article: DT Approved the submitted version for publication: DT, JH",166,28,2.85,14202103
A Conceptual Review of Lab-Based Aggression Paradigms,2018,Review article,4,1,10.1525/collabra.104,"Aggression is often defined as a behavior that is done with the intent to harm an individual who is believed to want avoid being harmed (e.g., Baron & Richardson, 1994). Accordingly, social scientists have developed several tasks to study aggression in laboratory settings; tasks that we refer to as “lab-based aggression paradigms.” However, because of the legal, ethical, and practical issues inherent in provoking aggression within the confines of a laboratory setting, it is feasible to study only very mildly harmful aggression. The current conceptual review examines the criteria that are necessary to study aggression in a laboratory setting, discusses the strengths and weaknesses of several new and/or commonly-used lab-based aggression paradigms, and offers recommendations for the future of lab-based aggression research. Collectively, we hope the current discussion helps researchers to describe the contributions and limitations of lab-based aggression research and, ultimately, helps to improve the informativeness of lab-based aggression research.","aggression, aggressive behaviors, validity, harsh behaviors, methodology",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.104/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.104/galley/140/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.104.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,The authors declare that they received no funding for the completion of this manuscript.,NA,1540,323,6.45,14056542
Reported Self-control is not Meaningfully Associated with Inhibition-related Executive Function: A Bayesian Analysis,2018,Original research report,4,1,10.1525/collabra.134,"Self-control is assessed using a remarkable array of measures. In a series of five data-sets (overall N = 2,641) and a mini meta-analysis, we explored the association between canonical operationalisations of self-control: The Self-Control Scale and two measures of inhibition-related executive functioning (the Stroop and Flanker paradigms). Overall, Bayesian correlational analyses suggested little-to-no relationship between self-reported self-control and performance on the Stroop and Flanker tasks. The Bayesian meta-analytical summary of all five data-sets further favoured a null relationship between both types of measurement. These results suggest that the field’s most widely used measure of self-reported self-control is uncorrelated with two of the most widely adopted executive functioning measures of self-control. Consequently, theoretical and practical conclusions drawn using one measure (e.g., the Self-Control Scale) cannot be generalised to findings using the other (e.g., the Stroop task). The lack of empirical correlation between measures of self-control do not invalidate either measure, but instead suggest that treatments of the construct of self-control need to pay greater attention to convergent validity among the many measures used to operationalize self-control.","self-control, cognitive control, inhibitory executive functioning, Bayesian statistics",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.134/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.134/galley/211/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.134.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,The data and scripts are available on our OSF page (https://osf.io/8etus/).,https://osf.io/8etus/,"Alexander Etz received funding from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program #DGE-1321846, and grant #1534472 from the National Science Foundation’s Methods, Measurements, and Statistics panel.","Saunders, Milyavskaya, Randles, and Inzlicht conceived the study.

A Practical Guide for Transparency in Psychological Science,2018,Review article,4,1,10.1525/collabra.158,"The credibility of scientific claims depends upon the transparency of the research products upon which they are based (e.g., study protocols, data, materials, and analysis scripts). As psychology navigates a period of unprecedented introspection, user-friendly tools and services that support open science have flourished. However, the plethora of decisions and choices involved can be bewildering. Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research (e.g., choosing a repository, preparing their research products for sharing, structuring folders, etc.). Being an open scientist means adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error prone, reproducible research workflows. Further, this adoption can be piecemeal – each incremental step towards complete transparency adds positive value. Transparent research practices not only improve the efficiency of individual researchers, they enhance the credibility of the knowledge generated by the scientific community.","transparency, open science, tutorial",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.158/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.158/galley/174/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.158.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"The authors thank Tim van der Zee and Kai Horstmann for helpful comments and Daniël Lakens for his help at the start of this project.

"Association between Social Class, Greed, and Unethical Behaviour: A Replication Study",2018,Original research report,4,1,10.1525/collabra.166,"Recent research has focused on the potential negative consequences of belonging to the upper class. The present study attempted to directly replicate previous research examining whether upper-class individuals had more positive attitudes toward greed than lower-class individuals, and whether these attitudes mediated the negative association between social class and unethical behaviour. The current research includes two studies with 317 and 320 participants, from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and Prolific Academic, respectively. We used the same measures and procedures of the original research. The resulting dataset, and analytic code, are hosted on the Open Science Framework (Clerke et al., 2017). Collectively these datasets provide access to data from over 600 participants pertaining to social class, ethical behaviour, and sociodemographic information, such as obtained education and religious and political orientation. As in the original, we found a significant positive correlation between SES and greed in one of two studies, however the size of the effect was smaller.

Emotional Congruence and Judgments of Honesty and Bias,2018,Original research report,4,1,10.1525/collabra.178,"Psychological and philosophical discussions typically understand honesty as reporting truth with propositional statements. In this model, emotions are often seen as irrelevant or a hindrance to honesty, because they can bias our reports. In relational contexts, however, emotions can provide information about deep-seated convictions. We report the results of a study (N = 827) finding that individuals whose emotional responses are congruent with their explicitly stated egalitarian positions are judged as significantly more honest and less prejudiced than those with incongruent emotional responses. This is seen in judgments of white male targets who have negative emotional responses to a black man, a gay man, and a female supervisor. These results suggest that emotional reactions provide information used when judging the honesty and bias of an individual.","Honesty, Emotion, Bias, Prejudice",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.178/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.178/galley/212/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.178.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"Materials, data, analysis scripts, and outputs in R Markdown are available at https://osf.io/tfmjp/.",https://osf.io/tfmjp/,AFD and JH acknowledge support from a John Templeton Foundation grant for their postdoctoral fellowships at the Institute for the Study of Human Flourishing at the University of Oklahoma.,"A.

Overconfidence Across Cultures,2018,Original research report,4,1,10.1525/collabra.153,"Overconfidence is a robust cognitive bias with far-reaching implications, but prior research on cultural differences in overconfidence has been conflicting. We present two studies that measure the three forms of overconfidence across cultures, allowing us to paint a more complete picture of cross-cultural overconfidence than previous studies. In Study 1, we compare overconfidence among participants from cultures traditionally considered individualistic (the US and UK) with participants from cultures traditionally conceptualized as collectivistic (India and China). In Study 2, we employ a new task to compare overconfidence in participants from the US and India. Our first key result is the successful cross-cultural replication, in both studies, of the effect of task difficulty on overestimation and overplacement, which bolsters our faith that our measures operate similarly across cultures. Our second key finding is that, while we find evidence of higher overestimation in our Indian participants, neither overplacement nor overprecision show consistent cross-cultural differences. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that previous findings of increased overconfidence in participants from collectivistic cultures may not be as robust as previously reported.","cross-cultural, overconfidence, overestimation, overplacement, overprecision",https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.153/,https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.153/galley/204/download/,http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.153.pr,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,Thanks to Luxi Shen for help collecting the Hong Kong sample.,"All the stimuli, presentation materials, participant data, and analysis scripts can be found on this paper’s project page on Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/nu6jt/.",https://osf.io/nu6jt/,This research was supported by internal funding at the Haas School of Business.,"Contributed to conception and design: DAM Contributed to acquisition of data: DAM, ASD, EYG Contributed to analysis and interpretation of data: ASD, EYG, DAM Drafted and/or revised the article: DAM, ASD, EYG Approved the submitted version for publication: DAM",564,149,1,13910193
"The Human Penguin Project: Climate, Social Integration, and Core Body Temperature",2018,Original research report,4,1,10.1525/collabra.165,"Social thermoregulation theory posits that modern human relationships are pleisiomorphically organized around body temperature regulation. In two studies (N = 1755) designed to test the principles from this theory, we used supervised machine learning to identify social and non-social factors that relate to core body temperature. This data-driven analysis found that complex social integration (CSI), defined as the number of high-contact roles one engages in, is a critical predictor of core body temperature. We further used a cross-validation approach to show that colder climates relate to higher levels of CSI, which in turn relates to higher CBT (when climates get colder).

Subsequently, we carried out a multiverse outlier re-analysis on the data of Brummelman and colleagues’ Study 3, employing the same analytical approach as the original authors did but excluding outliers. Out of the twelve re-analyses in the multiverse, six demonstrated that removing only a small number of outliers rendered the originally reported crucial interaction effect between self-esteem and type of praise non-significant and produced a sizeable reduction of the effect size.
