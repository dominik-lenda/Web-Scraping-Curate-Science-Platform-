Good News about Bad News: Gamified Inoculation Boosts Confidence and Cognitive Immunity Against Fake News,2020,Research article,3,1,10.5334/joc.91,"Recent research has explored the possibility of building attitudinal resistance against online misinformation through psychological inoculation. The inoculation metaphor relies on a medical analogy: by pre-emptively exposing people to weakened doses of misinformation cognitive immunity can be conferred. A recent example is the Bad News game, an online fake news game in which players learn about six common misinformation techniques. We present a replication and extension into the effectiveness of Bad News as an anti-misinformation intervention. We address three shortcomings identified in the original study: the lack of a control group, the relatively low number of test items, and the absence of attitudinal certainty measurements. Using a 2 (treatment vs. control) × 2 (pre vs. post) mixed design (N = 196) we measure participants’ ability to spot misinformation techniques in 18 fake headlines before and after playing Bad News. We find that playing Bad News significantly improves people’s ability to spot misinformation techniques compared to a gamified control group, and crucially, also increases people’s level of confidence in their own judgments. Importantly, this confidence boost only occurred for those who updated their reliability assessments in the correct direction. This study offers further evidence for the effectiveness of psychological inoculation against not only specific instances of fake news, but the very strategies used in its production. Implications are discussed for inoculation theory and cognitive science research on fake news.","Judgment, Decision making: Reasoning",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.91/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.91/galley/231/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"We would like to thank Ruurd Oosterwoud, DROG and Gusmanson Design for their efforts in helping to create the Bad News game.",NA,NA,The raw dataset necessary to reproduce the analyses reported in this paper can be retrieved from https://figshare.com/s/818c1a38da814b0bdf20.,https://figshare.com/s/818c1a38da814b0bdf20,The additional files for this article can be found as follows: Supplementary Table 1 Average reliability (pre-post) judgments overall and for each fake news badge by experimental condition.

Spatial Integration and the Underlying Mechanisms of Cross-Modality Interference,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.5,"Researchers have often utilized the classic Stroop task as a measure of selective attention processes. While it is largely agreed upon that semantic interference plays a role in the classic task, the role of attentional processes is less clear. The picture is further muddied when variations on the classic task are used. For example, the cross-modal Stroop task, in which one names the color of visual items while ignoring distracting auditory color words, typically leads to smaller sized interference effects and little or no facilitation when compared to the classic task. Furthermore, relationship(s) with working memory capacity have only been found in the classic version. We examined whether these differences are due to a methodological factor; namely, spatial integration versus separation of the target and distractor locations. We conducted four experiments manipulating the location of auditory distractors within the cross-modal Stroop task, and found that the location of the distractors had little to no impact on the size of the effect. This lack of an effect of location implies that the mechanisms contributing to the cross-modal Stroop effect are not the same as those of the classic Stroop effect, and that the role of spatial attention in cross-modal Stroop is limited. The implications of a unique role for auditory distractors is considered as well, and supports the conclusion that interference in the cross-modal Stroop effect is the result of a combination of semantic interference and modality-specific interference.","Stroop effect, cross-modal Stroop, spatial attention, goal maintenance, cross-modal distraction, auditory distraction",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.5/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.5/galley/12/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"These experiments consisted of two cross-modal (CM) Stroop tasks (within-subjects): Speaker CM Stroop and Headphones CM Stroop. In Speaker CM Stroop, the auditory distractor was presented from a pair of speakers located next to the computer screen, while in Headphones CM Stroop, the auditory distractors were heard from a set of over-the-ear headphones. The order of the two tasks (between-subjects) was counterbalanced to control for any potential impact of task order on performance. Congruent, incongruent, and control trials were presented to examine both interference and facilitation (within-subjects). Each task was completed in a separate block and began with nine practice trials followed by 162 experimental trials. The proportion of congruent, incongruent, and control trials was equal in both tasks – each auditory distraction condition was presented 54 times – and randomly intermixed. Squares were used as the to-be-named color carrying stimulus, and the auditory color words were a recorded female voice presented at a subjectively equal volume. There were three colors used throughout the entire experiment: red, blue, and green. These colors created six incongruent color combinations (red-green, red-blue, blue-red, blue-green, green-red, and green-blue) – each used nine times in each task – as well as three possible congruent pairings (red-red, blue-blue, and green-green) – seen 18 times in each task. Each trial began with a fixation cross in the center of the screen which remained for 500 ms followed by a color square. The onset of the sounds and color squares were simultaneous (there was no auditory distractor for control trials in Experiment 1, and in Experiment 2 it was a 500 ms tone). Participants were instructed to name the color of the square as quickly and accurately as possible and were asked not to wait for the auditory word to finish before initiating the response. A microphone connected to a response box logged the vocal onsets and response times of the participants. After the participant named the color, the experimenter answered three questions: what response was given by the participant, whether a false start had taken place (the microphone was triggered before the participant was able to give their response), and whether they had made an error in answering the first two questions. The experiments were presented using E-Prime 2.10 software on a Dell Dimension desktop computer with a 17-inch monitor.

Can Intrinsic and Extrinsic Metacognitive Cues Shield Against Distraction in Problem Solving?,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.9,"We investigated the capacity for two different forms of metacognitive cue to shield against auditory distraction in problem solving with Compound Remote Associates Tasks (CRATs). Experiment 1 demonstrated that an intrinsic metacognitive cue in the form of processing disfluency (manipulated using an easy-to-read vs. difficult-to-read font) could increase focal task engagement so as to mitigate the detrimental impact of distraction on solution rates for CRATs. Experiment 2 showed that an extrinsic metacognitive cue that took the form of an incentive for good task performance (i.e. 80% or better CRAT solutions) could likewise eliminate the negative impact of distraction on CRAT solution rates. Overall, these findings support the view that both intrinsic and extrinsic metacognitive cues have remarkably similar effects. This suggests that metacognitive cues operate via a common underlying mechanism whereby a participant applies increased focal attention to the primary task so as to ensure more steadfast task engagement that is not so easily diverted by task-irrelevant stimuli.","Auditory Distraction, Intrinsic and Extrinsic Metacognitive Cues, Processing Fluency, Problem Solving, Task Engagement",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.9/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.9/galley/34/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"Compound Remote Associate Tasks. A series of 20 CRATs were selected and divided into two sets of 10 problems each (i.e. Set A and Set B; see Appendix) so as to serve as problem-solving stimuli that could be presented in counterbalanced orders across the irrelevant speech versus quiet conditions of the within-participants distraction manipulation. Each set was matched in terms of mean solution rates (MSet A = .49, SDSet A = .26 vs. MSet B = .50; SDSet B = .26) and mean solution times (MSet A = 8.54s, SDSet A = 2.85 vs. MSet B = 8.56s; SDSet B = 2.83) using the normative data reported by Bowden and Jung-Beeman (2003). There was no significant difference across the two sets of CRATs for either the normed solution rates or the normed solution times (both ps > .05; refer to the Appendix for the Set A and Set B CRATs with normed solution-rate and solution-time data). For the processing disfluency manipulation, half of the participants received the CRAT problems presented in Arial 12-point font (easy-to-read) and half of the participants received the problems in 12-point Haettenschweiler font (difficult-to-read). Haettenschweiler was selected because prior studies (e.g., Diemand-Yauman et al., 2010; Halin, 2016; Halin, Marsh, Haga et al., 2014, Experiment 1; Lehmann, Goussios, & Seufert, 2016) have adopted this font to promote processing disfluency. Moreover, task difficulty is typically rated as higher when materials are presented in Haettenschweiler font (e.g., Halin, Marsh, Hellman et al., 2014, Experiment 1). Irrelevant speech. A transcript of a story was used as irrelevant speech for the task-irrelevant speech condition. The story was based on a mythical civilization known as “Ansarien” and was read in English by a male, native English speaker. The Swedish language version of this irrelevant speech has been used previously in studies of distraction by irrelevant speech (e.g., Halin, Marsh, & Sörqvist, 2015). The irrelevant speech transcript lasted 7 minutes in total, of which 2 minutes was used for the experiment. The irrelevant speech was delivered to a participant via a set of headphones from a PC computer at approximately 60–65 dB(A).",NA,Anonymized data for the two experiments reported in this article may be found at: http://doi.org/10.17030/uclan.data.00000149.,http://doi.org/10.17030/uclan.data.00000149,The Additional file for this article can be found as follows: Appendix A CRAT – answer – normed mean solution rate (%) and normed mean solution time (s).

"Pupillometry: Psychology, Physiology, and Function",2018,Review article,1,1,10.5334/joc.18,"Pupils respond to three distinct kinds of stimuli: they constrict in response to brightness (the pupil light response), constrict in response to near fixation (the pupil near response), and dilate in response to increases in arousal and mental effort, either triggered by an external stimulus or spontaneously. In this review, I describe these three pupil responses, how they are related to high-level cognition, and the neural pathways that control them. I also discuss the functional relevance of pupil responses, that is, how pupil responses help us to better see the world. Although pupil responses likely serve many functions, not all of which are fully understood, one important function is to optimize vision either for acuity (small pupils see sharper) and depth of field (small pupils see sharply at a wider range of distances), or for sensitivity (large pupils are better able to detect faint stimuli); that is, pupils change their size to optimize vision for a particular situation. In many ways, pupil responses are similar to other eye movements, such as saccades and smooth pursuit: like these other eye movements, pupil responses have properties of both reflexive and voluntary action, and are part of active visual exploration.","pupillometry, pupil light response, pupil near response, psychosensory pupil response, orienting response, eye movements",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.18/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.18/galley/36/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,Manuscript materials are available from:. https://github.com/smathot/pupillometry_review,https://github.com/smathot/pupillometry_review,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7295,2496
The Instructed Task-Switch Evaluation Effect: Is the Instruction to Switch Tasks Sufficient to Dislike Task Switch Cues?,2020,Research article,3,1,10.5334/joc.90,"It is often argued that people dislike situations in which there is conflict requiring cognitive control, possibly because it is effortful to resolve this conflict. In a recent study, Vermeylen, Braem, and Notebaert (2019) provided evidence for this idea in the context of task switching. They observed that participants evaluated cues signaling a task switch more negatively than cues signaling a task repetition in a task switching paradigm. The present study examined whether this evaluative bias can be observed also on the basis of mere instructions. We instructed participants that two non-words would either signal the requirement to switch or to repeat tasks in an upcoming task switching block, which was actually never administered. In Experiment 1, we did not observe more positive implicit or explicit evaluations of the instructed task repetition compared to the task switch cue. In Experiment 2, participants first completed a task switching block in which a first pair of transition cues were used. We then provided task switching instructions that described the signaling function of a second pair of cues, which would be used in an upcoming (but never administered) second task switching block. Participants showed a clear preference for both instructed and experienced task repetition cues on explicit but not on implicit evaluations. Experiment 3 replicated the instructed task-switch evaluation effect on explicit evaluations in the context of prior task experience (but not without prior experience) and extended it to implicit evaluations. We discuss theoretical implications and potential explanations of this task-switch evaluation effect.","Social cognition, Action, Cognitive Control",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.90/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.90/galley/229/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"The research reported in this paper was funded by the Scientific Research Foundation, Flanders under Grant FWO16/PDO/201 to PVD, and by the Ghent University Methusalem Grant BOF09/01M00209 to JDH.",NA,https://osf.io/ubp6c/,"All the materials related to this paper (the stimulus list, the data collected, the analysis scripts, and the tools that we used during the analysis) are publicly available at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ubp6c/).",https://osf.io/ubp6c/,NA,NA,NA,NA,31,8
Power Analysis and Effect Size in Mixed Effects Models: A Tutorial,2018,Review article,1,1,10.5334/joc.10,"In psychology, attempts to replicate published findings are less successful than expected. For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80%, whereas in practice less than 40% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants.

Temporal Context Influences the Perceived Duration of Everyday Actions: Assessing the Ecological Validity of Lab-Based Timing Phenomena,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.4,"Timing is key to accurate performance, for example when learning a new complex sequence by mimicry. However, most timing research utilizes artificial tasks and simple stimuli with clearly marked onset and offset cues. Here we address the question whether existing interval timing findings generalize to real-world timing tasks. In this study, animated video clips of a person performing different everyday actions were presented and participants had to reproduce the main action’s duration. Although reproduced durations are more variable then observed in laboratory studies, the data adheres to two interval timing laws: Relative timing sensitivity is constant across durations (scalar property), and the subjective duration of a previous action influenced the current action’s perceived duration (temporal context effect). Taken together, this demonstrates that laboratory findings generalize, and paves the way for studying interval timing as a component of complex, everyday cognitive performance.","Time perception, Memory, Event cognition",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.4/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.4/galley/6/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"Participants Twenty-three students enrolled in the Psychology programme of the University of Groningen (mean age: 19.3 years, range: 18–22 years, 17 female) participated in the experiment and received partial course credit. Sample size was based on past research (e.g., 12 participants in Carrozzo & Lacquaniti, 2013; 38 participants in van Rijn, 2014). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent as approved by the Psychology Ethical Committee of the University of Groningen (15008-NE) was obtained before testing. Stimuli Videos of an animated human reference model (see below for details) performing six different actions recorded from third- and first-person perspectives and performed over shorter or longer durations served as stimuli. The actions were drink (figure drinks from a cup), mix (figure uses a whisk to mix something in a bowl), pour (figure pours a liquid into a cup), put on (figure picks up a bowl and puts it on another object), take down (figure picks up a bowl placed on another object and puts it down on the table), and pick & place (figure picks up a whisk and puts it down at a different location on the table). All action-related objects were located on a table before and put back on the table after the actions were performed. Importantly, video length was not correlated with the speed of the action (e.g., drinking fast), but video length determined how long an action, performed at normal speed, was executed. Animated videos were based on video recordings of a human actress performing each of the six actions over different time spans (Figure 1, top row). Movements were recorded by a marker-based motion capture system (VICON, http://www.vicon.com, sampling rate of 100 Hz, marker position accuracy < 1 mm). Human movement recordings were encoded using the Master Motor Map (MMM) toolkit (Terlemez et al., 2015), which is underlying a generic framework for unified representation and transfer of whole-body human motions to different embodiments (e.g., humanoid robots or animated characters). Finally, the scene and the animated human reference model were generated with MMM-based animated characters and 3D object models (e.g., a red cup) as described in Wächter and Asfour (2015) and illustrated in Figure 1. The entire motion data set, including MMM representations and object models, is publicly available as a part of the KIT whole-body human motion database (available at: https://motion-database.humanoids.kit.edu/) (Mandery, Terlemez, Do, Vahrenkamp, & Asfour, 2015). We chose to use an animated human reference model instead of human actors to control for confounding factors like variations in background noise or emotions conveyed by facial expressions (e.g., Fayolle & Droit-Volet, 2014). With 6 actions, 2 perspectives, and 2 length condition, a total of 24 animated videos were created to be used as stimuli. Procedure Participants were seated, at normal operating distance, in front of a Iiyama Vision Master Pro 513, 22 inch screen with a resolution of 1024 × 768 px and a refresh rate setting of 100 Hz. Participants were provided with instructions informing them that they would be asked to reproduce the duration of an action observed in the video presented on that trial. Each experimental trial started with the presentation of a short text describing the action that would be presented (e.g., “mixing”). After 3 s, one of the 24 videos was presented centrally with a resolution of 960 × 540 pixels. After the end of the video the screen went blank for 1 s, followed by a grey circle presented in the centre of the screen. This circle indicated that participants could reproduce the duration of the action by pressing down the spacebar. As a visual aid, the grey circled turned white while the spacebar was pressed down (i.e. during the interval reproduction). One additional trial sampled randomly from the 24 available videos served as a practice trial at the beginning of the experiment. Data from this trial were not analysed. Importantly, no explicit instructions (or visual or auditory aids) were provided to indicate when an interval was supposed to start or end; the start- and endpoints of a specific action had to be determined by the participants themselves. However, it was explicitly stated in the instructions that the start- and endpoint of the action would not necessarily coincide with the start and end of the video. Videos were presented in random order. Each video was presented four times, resulting in a total of 96 trials. The experiment was programmed in OpenSesame version 3.0.3 (Mathôt, Schreij, & Theeuwes, 2012). The experimental script is available online at: http://osf.io/y9zex. Objective Durations To compare the reproduced durations to objective durations, we computed objective durations using the Semantic Event Chain (SEC) extraction algorithm that is used in AI and robotics to decompose actions or action sequences into atomic (sub-)actions (Aksoy, Aein, Tamosiunaite, & Worgotter, 2015; Wächter & Asfour, 2015). During SEC extraction, videos are examined and segmented according to spatiotemporal hand-object relations and actions can be categorized (e.g., approach, grasp, withdraw) based on semantic object-object and object-hand contact relations. Based on this segmentation process, we defined the duration of the main action as lasting from the first contact with the involved object until letting go of that object, resulting in the following durations (ordered from shortest to longest): 0.83s (take down short version), 0.96s (put on short), 1.07s (pick & place short), 1.82s (pick & place long), 1.88s (put on long), 2.32s (drink short), 3.02s (take down long), 3.24s (mix short), 3.68s (pour short), 6.63s (mix long), 8.06s (pour long), 8.92s (drink long). We validated this algorithm in an additional experiment (see Supplemental Material available at: https://osf.io/y9zex). Data Analysis The data analyses focused on three main questions: (1) Do the local and global context influence the perceived duration; (2) Is there an effect of perspective on perceived duration; (3) Is the scalar property observed in these data, operationalized by two different measures discussed below. For these analyses, we created Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) using the lme4 package (version 1.1–10; Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014) in R version 3.2.2 (R Development Core Team, 2008). To test whether including a fixed factor improved the LMM, we performed model comparisons using likelihood ratio tests. Participant and action were always entered as random intercepts. After model comparison, we sequentially added random slopes for participant and the fixed factors, and action and the fixed factors (excluding objective duration), to the model to test whether this affected the results. In all LMM analyses, we found that the random slopes did not change the effects of the fixed factors qualitatively. Therefore, we will report the results of the simpler random intercept models here. For both significant and non-significant fixed factors in the LMMs, we used Bayesian analyses to quantify the evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis. To this end, we compared the model including the fixed factor with the model without the factor using the lmBF function from the BayesFactor package in R (Morey, Rouder, & Jamil, 2014). The evidence for H1 over H0 will be denoted as BF10. All analysis scripts and data are available at: http://osf.io/y9zex. First, we tested the data for context effects. To test whether there was a global pull towards the (subjective) mean, an LMM was estimated with bias (the difference between the reproduction and the objective duration) as dependent variable and objective lag as fixed factor. Whereas perfect reproduction would yield a bias that is consistently 0 over durations, a pull towards the mean would result in a negative effect of duration on bias. To investigate local context effects, we tested the effect of the previous (n-1, n-2, …) subjective duration (i.e. the previous produced duration) and the previous objective duration (i.e. the objective duration of the action, as provided by the action segmentation algorithm) on the current trial (i.e. the current produced duration). Reproduced action duration was entered as dependent variable. Objective duration of the current trial, perspective, and previous subjective or objective trial duration were entered as predictors. Following Taatgen and van Rijn (2011), we iteratively compared more complex models (e.g., a model including n-3, n-2, n-1) with simpler models (e.g., a model including n-2 and n-1). The same model comparison approach was used to test for effects of perspective. To test the data for the scalar property, following Wearden and Lejeune (2008), the coefficient of determination (r2) was determined by correlating the standard deviation of the reproduced action duration (S), averaged over all participants, with the mean reproduced duration (M) of each action in the long and short condition separately (i.e. for the 12 unique action-duration combinations, data from the different perspectives was pooled together).

On the Right Track? Investigating the Effect of Path Characteristics on Visuospatial Bootstrapping in Verbal Serial Recall,2017,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.2,"Visuospatial bootstrapping (VSB) occurs when memory for verbal material is enhanced via association with meaningful visuospatial information. Sequences of digits are visually presented either in the center of the screen or within a keypad layout in which the digits may be arranged identically to familiar pin pad and mobile phone layouts, or randomly. Recall is consistently higher when digits are presented in the familiar layout. This “bootstrapping” could involve primarily long-term knowledge of the layout, primarily short-term memory of the unique spatial path, or may depend on both. We manipulated the path complexity of sequences to test whether the VSB effect depends on the quality of spatial representations in conjunction with the familiarity of the spatial layout in two experiments. We consistently observed both VSB effects and path complexity effects on verbal serial recall, but never observed any interaction between these factors, even when articulatory suppression was imposed. Analysis of recall by serial position revealed that the VSB effect was focused on the end-of-list items. Our finding of pervasive path complexity effects on verbal serial recall suggests incidental encoding of spatial path occurs during visually-presented verbal tasks regardless of layout familiarity, confirming that spatial factors can affect verbal recall, but ruling out the notion that incidental spatial paths are uniquely and voluntarily encoded with familiar layouts.","working memory, spatial memory, serial recall, visual short-term memory, path complexity",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.2/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.2/galley/9/download/,Candice Morey is Editor in Chief of the Journal of Cognition and was removed from all editorial processing for this paper.

Perceptual Processing is Not Spared During the Attentional Blink,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.20,"Identification of the second of two targets is impaired when these appear within 500 ms of each other. This phenomenon, known as the attentional blink (AB) is thought to reflect disrupted post-perceptual processing. Yet, decisive empirical support for this claim is lacking. We measured the depth of the AB, while manipulating the second target’s reporting feature. We reasoned that if perceptual processing is unaffected by the blink, all the features of the blinked target should have equal access to working memory. In contrast with this prediction, we found identity and semantic-category reports to be more severely impaired by the blink than color reports, although baseline performance was similar in the two report conditions. These findings suggest that high-level features are more poorly represented in working memory than low-level features during the blink. We conclude that the attentional blink disrupts perceptual processing. Implications for contemporary models of the attentional blink are discussed.","Attention, Semantics, Word processing, Visual perception, Consciousness, Working memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.20/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.20/galley/40/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,https://doi.org/10.5334/joc.20.s1,Data from all experiments is available at figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5492611).,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5492611,The Additional file for this article can be found as follows: Supplementary materials Distractor Intrusion Analysis.

Effects of Prior-Task Success on Young and Older Adults’ Cognitive Performance an Evaluation of the Strategy Hypothesis,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.17,"In prior-task success, older adults improve cognitive performance on target tasks after successfully accomplishing a prior task. We tested the hypothesis that effects of prior-task success occur via older adults’ selecting the better strategy more often and executing strategies more efficiently on each problem under a prior-task success condition. Young and older participants accomplished computational estimation tasks (i.e., providing the best estimates to arithmetic problems) under a success or a control condition. They successfully accomplished a Stroop task or accomplished no prior task before taking the target arithmetic task. Participants had to select the better strategy on each problem in Experiment 1 and to execute a cue strategy in Experiment 2. Consistent with the strategy hypothesis, older adults, but not young adults, (a) obtained better performance, (b) used the better strategy more often, (c) inappropriately repeated the same strategy less often across successive problems, and (d) executed strategies more efficiently, under a prior-task success condition relative to a control condition. These results highlight the role of strategic variations in effects of prior-task success.

Number and Continuous Magnitude Processing Depends on Task Goals and Numerosity Ratio,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.22,"A large body of evidence shows that when comparing non-symbolic numerosities, performance is influenced by irrelevant continuous magnitudes, such as total surface area, density, etc. In the current work, we ask whether the weights given to numerosity and continuous magnitudes are modulated by top-down and bottom-up factors. With that aim in mind, we asked adult participants to compare two groups of dots. To manipulate task demands, participants reported after every trial either (1) how accurate their response was (emphasizing accuracy) or (2) how fast their response was (emphasizing speed). To manipulate bottom-up factors, the stimuli were presented for 50 ms, 100 ms or 200 ms. Our results revealed (a) that the weights given to numerosity and continuous magnitude ratios were affected by the interaction of top-down and bottom-up manipulations and (b) that under some conditions, using numerosity ratio can reduce efficiency. Accordingly, we suggest that processing magnitudes is not rigid and static but a flexible and adaptive process that allows us to deal with the ever-changing demands of the environment. We also argue that there is not just one answer to the question ‘what do we process when we process magnitudes?’, and future studies should take this flexibility under consideration.","Non-symbolic numerosity comparison task, continuous magnitudes, numerosities, sense of number, sense of magnitudes",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.22/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.22/galley/42/download/,The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.,NA,NA,NA,The data of this ms is available online in the link: https://osf.io/rmbf8/.,https://osf.io/rmbf8/,The Additional file for this article can be found as follows: Supplementary material Elaborated regression analysis.

Compatibility between Physical Stimulus Size and Left-right Responses: Small is Left and Large is Right,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.19,"According to a theory of magnitude (ATOM, Walsh, 2003, 2015), the cognitive representations of quantity, time, and space share a general magnitude code. Interestingly though, research has largely ignored the relationship between physical (stimulus) size and spatial (response) location. We conducted two experiments investigating compatibility effects between physical stimulus size and left-right responses. In both experiments, right-handed participants responded to a small or a large square stimulus by pressing a left or a right key. In Experiment 1, size was the relevant stimulus feature and we varied the S-R mapping within participants. Results revealed a strong compatibility effect: Performance was better with the compatible mapping (small-left and large-right) than with the incompatible mapping (large-left and small-right). In Experiment 2, participants responded to stimulus color, which varied independently of stimulus size, by pressing a left or right key. Results showed a congruency effect that mirrored the compatibility effect of Experiment 1. The results of our experiments suggest a strong relationship between the cognitive representation of physical (stimulus) size and response location in right-handers.

Metacognition in Auditory Distraction: How Expectations about Distractibility Influence the Irrelevant Sound Effect,2017,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.3,"Task-irrelevant, to-be-ignored sound disrupts serial short-term memory for visually presented items compared to a quiet control condition. We tested whether disruption by changing state irrelevant sound is modulated by expectations about the degree to which distractors would disrupt serial recall performance. The participants’ expectations were manipulated by providing the (bogus) information that the irrelevant sound would be either easy or difficult to ignore. In Experiment 1, piano melodies were used as auditory distractors. Participants who expected the degree of disruption to be low made more errors in serial recall than participants who expected the degree of disruption to be high, independent of whether distractors were present or not. Although expectation had no effect on the magnitude of disruption, participants in the easy-to-ignore group reported after the experiment that they were less disrupted by the irrelevant sound than participants in the difficult-to-ignore group. In Experiment 2, spoken texts were used as auditory distractors. Expectations about the degree of disruption did not affect serial recall performance. Moreover, the subjective and objective distraction by irrelevant speech was similar in the easy-to-ignore group and in the difficult-to-ignore group. Thus, while metacognitive beliefs about whether the auditory distractors would be easy or difficult to ignore can have an effect on task engagement and subjective distractibility ratings, they do not seem to have an effect on the actual degree to which the auditory distractors disrupt serial recall performance.","metacognition, cognitive control, working memory, short-term memory, music cognition, emotion and cognition",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.3/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.3/galley/7/download/,The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,"Correspondence concerning this article and should be addressed to Jan Philipp Röer, Department for Psychology and Psychotherapy, Witten/Herdecke University, Alfred-Herrhausen-Straße 50, 58448 Witten, Germany.

“Top-down” Does Not Mean “Voluntary”,2018,Commentaries,1,1,10.5334/joc.28,"Attention researchers have long debated the roles of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in controlling attention. Theeuwes (2018) has argued that that top-down control is much less common than typically assumed and that a third mechanism—selection history—plays an underappreciated role in guiding visual attention. Although Theeuwes has made a strong case for the importance of selection history, his arguments for a limited role of top-down mechanisms involve conflating the terms “top-down” and “voluntary.” Cognitive psychologists typically use the term “top-down” processing to refer to any perceptual phenomenon that is influenced by context, learning, or expectation, which would include selection history. This highlights a broad problem in attention capture research: The terms used to describe attentional control are often poorly defined, and much current debate seems to be related to the meaning of words. To move forward in understanding the actual mechanisms of attentional control, we must agree on what terms such as “top-down” and “bottom-up” actually mean.","attentional capture, visual attention, selection history",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.28/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.28/galley/56/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,809,298
About Face: Seeing the Talker Improves Spoken Word Recognition but Increases Listening Effort,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.89,"It is widely accepted that seeing a talker improves a listener’s ability to understand what a talker is saying in background noise (e.g., Erber, 1969; Sumby & Pollack, 1954). The literature is mixed, however, regarding the influence of the visual modality on the listening effort required to recognize speech (e.g., Fraser, Gagné, Alepins, & Dubois, 2010; Sommers & Phelps, 2016). Here, we present data showing that even when the visual modality robustly benefits recognition, processing audiovisual speech can still result in greater cognitive load than processing speech in the auditory modality alone. We show using a dual-task paradigm that the costs associated with audiovisual speech processing are more pronounced in easy listening conditions, in which speech can be recognized at high rates in the auditory modality alone—indeed, effort did not differ between audiovisual and audio-only conditions when the background noise was presented at a more difficult level. Further, we show that though these effects replicate with different stimuli and participants, they do not emerge when effort is assessed with a recall paradigm rather than a dual-task paradigm. Together, these results suggest that the widely cited audiovisual recognition benefit may come at a cost under more favorable listening conditions, and add to the growing body of research suggesting that various measures of effort may not be tapping into the same underlying construct (Strand et al., 2018).","Auditory word processing, Multi-sensory perception, Attention",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.89/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.89/galley/226/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,The authors would like to thank Jonathan Peelle for helpful feedback on an earlier draft of this paper and the undergraduate research assistants at Carleton College for helpful conversations and assistance with data collection.

Working Memory Capacity Limits Memory for Bindings,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.86,"I propose that the capacity of working memory places a specific limit on the maintenance of temporary bindings. Two experiments support this binding hypothesis: Participants remembered word lists of varying length. When tested on a randomly selected word, their error rates increased with the length of the list, reflecting a limited capacity for short-term maintenance. This increase in errors was predominantly due to binding errors: People confused the correct word with other words of the current memory list, but very rarely with words not in the list. The frequencies of response choices were analyzed through two measurement models – one based on the assumption of discrete memory states, one on the assumption of continuous memory strength – that capture memory for items and for bindings in separate parameters. Increasing memory set size impaired binding memory but not item memory, supporting the binding hypothesis.","Working memory, Mathematical modelling, Short-term memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.86/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.86/galley/212/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,"The large pool consisted of 1198 German nouns with a length of less than 16 characters, drawn at random from the data base Semantischer Atlas (Schwibbe, n.d.). The small pool for each participant was a new random set of 16 words drawn from the large pool. For the large-pool experiment, the words for each memory list were drawn at random without replacement from the pool. The response set consisted of a subset of these memory words and a set of new words, also drawn without replacement from the pool. When the pool was exhausted, it was re-instated in full, and sampling resumed as before. In this way, words could be used a second time only after all words from the pool have been used once, so that a new word in the set of response options, if it has occurred before in the experiment at all, had occurred many trials ago. For the small-pool experiment, the list words and the new words to be included in the response set were sampled from the pool without replacement in each trial; after each trial the pool was re-instated in full, so that the same words could be (and usually were) re-used on the next trial. The list items included in the response set were chosen by first ordering all list items by their positional distance to the tested item, from smallest to largest. From that ranked list I chose the first RSSList items. This procedure avoids a confound between memory set size and the average positional distance of response options to the tested item. If response options were drawn at random from the list without constraint, their average distance from the tested item would increase with set size. Because people tend to confuse list items more with closer than with more distant neighbors on the list (Hitch, 1974; Lee & Estes, 1977), this confound would lead to an underestimation of the set-size effect.",NA,All raw data and R code are available at the OSF: osf.io/qy5sd.,osf.io/qy5sd,The additional files for this article can be found as follows: Appendix A Priors for Logistic Regression.

"Momentary, Offset-Triggered Dual-Task Interference in Visual Working Memory",2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.84,"There are conflicting views on whether the storage of visual working memory (VWM) involves active maintenance mechanism. If so, it should suffer from secondary tasks that tap into the same mechanisms during the delay. We found that when observers were asked to remember a visual pattern, the interference from a secondary task was only momentary. This suggests that active attentional processing may serves the initial consolidation, rather than maintenance, of information during the delay period. In three experiments, observers remembered a visual grating while having to perform an intervening change detection task on sets of letters presented at various intervals from the to-be-memorized pattern. The secondary task affected memory on the first task, but only for a limited time window post stimulus offset. We furthermore show that this temporary interference is locked to the offset rather than the onset of the to-be-memorized pattern, suggesting that attention may be transiently recruited for consolidation on a just-in-time basis.","Visual working memory, Attention, Consolidation, Dual-task interference",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.84/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.84/galley/208/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,Data can be accessed through https://github.com/wangbenchi/Consolidation_VWM.,https://github.com/wangbenchi/Consolidation_VWM,NA,NA,"This research was supported by a European Research Council (ERC) consolidator grant [ERC-CoG-615423] to Christian Olivers, and a China Scholarship Council (CSC) scholarship (201508330313) to Benchi Wang.","BW, JT, and CO designed the experiment, BW collected and analyzed the data, BW and CO wrote the paper.

Sequence Knowledge on When and What Supports Dual-Tasking,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.76,"The constraints in overlapping response selection have been established in dual-tasking studies with random sequence of stimuli and responses as well as random stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). While this approach makes it possible to control for advance activation of upcoming stimuli or responses, it leaves open whether such preparatory processing can indeed influence dual-task performance. We investigated whether and how the sequence of stimuli and responses and the sequence of SOAs can be learned and used under dual-tasking. In each trial, participants (N = 28 in Experiment 1 and N = 30 in Experiment 2) were first presented with a random two-choice task followed by a four-choice Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT), presented in a sequence of length four (position sequence). The SOA (timing) sequence also had length four. In test phases, one or both of the sequences were randomized. Results showed that both position and timing sequences were learned and supported dual-task performance, suggesting that predictive processing with respect to timing and identity of stimuli and responses can help to circumvent the response selection bottleneck constraints. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work on acquisition of interval sequences in single tasking, we found that the sequence of what (i.e. stimulus) and the sequence of when (i.e. interval between two tasks) contributed independently to performance.","sequence learning, stimulus-response sequence, temporal sequence, action effect of response, SRTT",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.76/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.76/galley/171/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,We thank our student assistant Christina Weckwerth for data collection in Experiment 2.

How Not to Fall for the White Bear: Combined Frequency and Recency Manipulations Diminish Negation Effects on Overt Behavior,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.62,"Processing negated mental representations comes with a price: Not only are negations harder to resolve than affirmative statements, but they may even invoke ironic effects, producing the exact opposite of the intended outcome. Negation effects also behave ironically when subjected to high-frequency training; when they are confronted often, the difficulty to process negations strangely increases. Here we show that negation effects can be mitigated under certain circumstances. Based on models of cognitive control and conflict adaptation, we hypothesized that negation effects diminish when two criteria are met: negations have to be resolved not only frequently, but also just recently. We confirmed this prediction in two experiments by using an innovative, two-dimensional finger tracking design, in which we measured the influence of the original semantic content during negation processing via temporal and spatial measures. Negation effects were present throughout the experiment, but were reduced after recent negations, particularly during or after a high-frequency negation context. The combined influence of frequency and recency thus seems to be the most successful and promising attempt to mitigate ironic negation effects on overt behavior.","Cognitive Control, Action, Working memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.62/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.62/galley/142/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,"The raw data, aggregated data, analytic scripts, and the full results are available at www.osf.io/kzwp6.",NA,"The additional file for this article can be found as follows: Supplementary Material Full results, additional analyses, and stimulus material.

Does Learning Influence the Detection of Signals in a Response-Inhibition Task?,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.73,"Learning can modulate various forms of action control, including response inhibition. People may learn associations between specific stimuli and the acts of going or stopping, influencing task performance. The present study tested whether people also learn associations between specific stimuli and features of the stop or no-go signal used in the task. Across two experiments, participants performed a response-inhibition task in which the contingencies between specific stimuli and the spatial locations of the ‘go’ and ‘withhold’ signals were manipulated. The contingencies between specific stimuli and either going or withholding were also manipulated, such that a subset of stimuli were associated with responding and another subset with withholding a response. Although there was clear evidence that participants learned to associate specific stimuli with the acts of going or withholding, there was no evidence that participants acquired the spatial signal-location associations. The absence of signal learning was supported by Bayesian analyses. These findings challenge our previous proposals that learning always influences signal-detection processes in response-inhibition tasks where features of the signal remain the same throughout the task.","Cognitive Control, Attention, Executive functions, Learning",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.73/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.73/galley/176/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,"https://osf.io/j6tk9/?view_only=329b1312f7524ef58bb43050e5100cd0, https://osf.io/j6tk9/?view_only=329b1312f7524ef58bb43050e5100cd0",All data files and analysis scripts are deposited in the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/j6tk9/?view_only=329b1312f7524ef58bb43050e5100cd0).,https://osf.io/j6tk9/?view_only=329b1312f7524ef58bb43050e5100cd0,"The additional file for this article can be found as follows: Supplementary Material Words used in Experiments 1 & 2, on-screen task instructions and eye-movement data analyses.

Task Difficulty Modulates the Disrupting Effects of Oral Respiration on Visual Search Performance,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.77,"Previous research has suggested that oral respiration may disturb cognitive function and health. The present study investigated whether oral respiration negatively affects visual attentional processing during a visual search task. Participants performed a visual search task in the following three breathing conditions: wearing a nasal plug, wearing surgical tape over their mouths, or no modification (oral vs. nasal vs. control). The participants searched for a target stimulus within different set sizes of distractors in three search conditions (orientation vs colour vs conjunction). Experiment 1 did not show any effect due to respiration. Experiment 2 rigorously manipulated the search efficiency and found that participants required more time to find a poorly discriminable target during oral breathing compared with other breathing styles, which was due to the heightened intercept under this condition. Because the intercept is an index of pre-search sensory processing or motor response in visual search, such cognitive processing was likely disrupted by oral respiration. These results suggest that oral respiration and attentional processing during inefficient visual search share a common cognitive resource.","Attention, Visual search, Action",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.77/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.77/galley/181/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,The authors wish to thank Daiichiro Kuroki for technical assistance with the experiments.,NA,NA,Anonymized datasets are publicly available at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/cjz79/).,https://osf.io/cjz79/,NA,NA,"This experiment was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grants JP19J21874 (N.Y.), JP15H05709 (Y.Y.), JP16H01866 (Y.Y.), JP17H00875 (Y.Y.), JP18K12015 (Y.Y.), and JP18H04199 (Y.Y.).","NY designed the experiments, performed the data acquisition, interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript.

The Forward Testing Effect is Reliable and Independent of Learners’ Working Memory Capacity,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.82,"The forward testing effect refers to the finding that retrieval practice of previously studied information enhances learning and retention of subsequently studied other information. While most of the previous research on the forward testing effect examined group differences, the present study took an individual differences approach to investigate this effect. Experiment 1 examined whether the forward effect has test-retest reliability between two experimental sessions. Experiment 2 investigated whether the effect is related to participants’ working memory capacity. In both experiments (and each session of Experiment 1), participants studied three lists of items in anticipation of a final cumulative recall test. In the testing condition, participants were tested immediately on lists 1 and 2, whereas in the restudy condition, they restudied lists 1 and 2. In both conditions, participants were tested immediately on list 3. On the group level, the results of both experiments demonstrated a forward testing effect, with interim testing of lists 1 and 2 enhancing immediate recall of list 3. On the individual level, the results of Experiment 1 showed that the forward effect on list 3 recall has moderate test-retest reliability between two experimental sessions. In addition, the results of Experiment 2 showed that the forward effect on list 3 recall does not depend on participants’ working memory capacity. These findings suggest that the forward testing effect is reliable at the individual level and affects learners at a wide range of working memory capacities alike. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","Memory, Long-term memory, Working memory, Learning",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.82/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.82/galley/202/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,"Item material and data can be found at Open Science Framework, DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TFP4S.",https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TFP4S,NA,NA,The publication was funded by the Open Access Fund of Universität Trier and the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Open Access Publishing funding programme.,BP and CF developed the study concept and experimental design.

On the Assimilation of Instructions: Stimulus-response Associations are Implemented but not Stimulus-task Associations,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.78,"The assimilation of instructions consists of two stages. First, a task model is formed on the basis of instructions. Second, this model is implemented, resulting in highly accessible representations, which enable reflexive behavior that guides the application of instructions. Research frequently demonstrated that instructions can lead to automatic response activation, which indicates that stimulus-response associations can be implemented on the basis of a task model. However, instructions not only indicate how to respond (stimulus-response mappings) but also when (i.e., the conditions under which mappings apply). Accordingly, we tested whether instruction implementation leads both to the activation of stimulus-response associations and of associations between stimuli and the context or task in which the instructed stimulus-response mappings are relevant (i.e., stimulus-task associations). In four experiments, we measured if implementing newly instructed stimulus-response mappings also leads to bivalence costs (i.e., shorter latencies when a stimulus can only occur in one task compared to when it can occur in two tasks), which indicate the presence of stimulus-task associations. We consistently observed automatic response activation on the basis of instructions, but no bivalence costs. A discrepancy thus exists between information conveyed in an instructed task model and the elements of that task model that are implemented. We propose that future research on automatic effects of instructions should broaden its scope and focus both on the formation of an instructed task model and its subsequent implementation.","Cognitive Control, Action, Attention",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.78/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.78/galley/178/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,"https://osf.io/zspjq/, https://osf.io/zspjq/",Raw data and corresponding processing scripts of all experiments are deposited at https://osf.io/zspjq/.,https://osf.io/zspjq/,NA,NA,NA,NA,105,24
Get the Picture? Goodness of Image Organization Contributes to Image Memorability,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.80,"According to Gestalt psychologists, goodness is a crucial variable for image organization. We hypothesized that these differences in goodness contribute to variability in image memorability. Building on this, we predicted that two characteristics of good organizations, (i) fast, efficient processing and (ii) robustness against transformations (e.g., shrinking), would be characteristic of memorable images. Two planned (Study 1, Study 2) and one follow-up (Study 3) study were conducted to test this. Study 1 operationalized fast processing as accuracy in a rapid-scene categorization task (“categorizability”). Study 2 operationalized robustness against shrinking as reaction time in a thumbnail search task (“shrinkability”). We used 44 real-life scene images of 14 semantic categories from a previous memorability study. Each image was assigned a categorizability and shrinkability score. The predicted positive relation between categorizability and memorability was not observed in Study 1. A post-hoc explanation attributed this null result to a masking role of image distinctiveness. Furthermore, memorable images were located faster in the thumbnail search task, as predicted, but Study 2 could not rule whether this was merely a result of their distinctiveness. To elucidate these results, Study 3 quantified the images on distinctiveness and statistically controlled for this variable in a reanalysis of Study 1 and Study 2. When distinctiveness was controlled for, categorizability and memorability did show a significant positive correlation. Moreover, the results also argued against the alternative explanation of the results of Study 2. Taken together, the results support the hypothesis that goodness of organization contributes to image memorability.","Memory, Visual perception, Vision",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.80/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.80/galley/197/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,"The novel data discussed in this manuscript can be downloaded from our repository on the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/APKSE.

Dissociations between Learning Phenomena do Not Necessitate Multiple Learning Processes: Mere Instructions about Upcoming Stimulus Presentations Differentially Influence Liking and Expectancy,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.59,"Prior research showed that the degree of statistical contingency between the presence of stimuli moderates changes in expectancies about the presence of those stimuli (i.e., expectancy learning) but not changes in the liking of those stimuli (i.e., evaluative conditioning). This dissociation is typically interpreted as evidence for dual process models of associative learning. We tested an alternative account according to which both types of learning rely on a single process propositional learning mechanism but reflect different kinds of propositional beliefs. In line with the idea that changes in liking reflect beliefs about stimulus co-occurrences whereas changes in expectancy reflect beliefs about stimulus contingency, we found that evaluative ratings depended only on instructions about whether a stimulus would co-occur with a positive or negative stimulus whereas expectancy ratings were influenced also by instructions about individual stimulus presentations.","Learning, Emotion and cognition, Memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.59/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.59/galley/131/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"JDH, SM, PVD, Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University.

How Does the (Re)Presentation of Instructions Influence Their Implementation?,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.63,"Instructions are so effective that they can sometimes affect performance beyond the instructed context. Such ‘automatic’ effects of instructions (AEI) have received much interest recently. It has been argued that AEI are restricted to relatively simple and specific S-R tasks or action plans. The present study put this idea further to the test. In a series of experiments based on the NEXT paradigm (Meiran, Pereg, Kessler, Cole, & Braver, 2015a) we investigated the specificity of AEI. In Experiment 1, we presented category-response instructions instead of S-R instructions. Nevertheless, we observed AEI for novel stimuli from the instructed category (Experiment 1a), and abstractness of the category did not modulate the size of the NEXT effect (Experiment 1b). However, Experiment 2 revealed specificity at the response level: AEI were much smaller in conditions where the instructed GO response is semantically related to, but procedurally different from the required NEXT response, compared to a condition where the NEXT and GO responses were the same. Combined, these findings indicate that AEI can occur when S(C)-R instructions are abstract at the stimulus level, arguing against previous proposals. However, AEI does seem to require specificity at the response level. We discuss implications for recent theories of instruction-based learning and AEI.","Action and perception, Categorisation, Cognitive Control, Learning",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.63/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.63/galley/140/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,We would like to thank Rosamund McLaren and Ruichong Shuai for their help in data acquisition.,NA,"https://osf.io/4hmpv/, https://osf.io/4hmpv/","All raw data files, R scripts (for data analysis), Matlab scripts (for data collection) and stimuli from all experiments are stored on the Open Science Framework data repository (https://osf.io/4hmpv/).",https://osf.io/4hmpv/,NA,NA,This work was supported by the European Research Council (grant numbers 312445 and 769595 awarded to Frederick Verbruggen).,"Contributed to conception and design: CSL, BL, FV.

Age-Related Degree and Criteria Differences in Semantic Categorization,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.74,"Individual differences in semantic categorization are commonplace. Individuals apply a word like SPORTS to different instances because they employ different conditions for category membership (vagueness in criteria) or because they differ regarding the extent to which they feel the term can be applied given fixed conditions (vagueness in degree). Three individuals may, for instance, disagree as to whether chess and hiking are SPORTS, because one believes SPORTS are competitive in nature, while the other two require SPORTS to be effortful (vagueness in criteria). On the basis of whether they consider hiking sufficiently effortful or not, the latter two individuals might still disagree as to whether to call it a SPORT (vagueness in degree). We investigated whether there are systematic age-related differences in semantic categorization by analyzing the categorization decisions of 1,868 adults for eight semantic categories with a formal model that allows the two sources of categorization differences to be disentangled. We found that young and older adults assess instances differently with respect to the categorization conditions and that older adults employ a lower threshold for category membership than young adults do. We recommend that these criteria and degree differences are taken into account in studies of age-related semantic processing.","Ageing, Categorisation, Mathematical modelling, Semantics",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.74/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.74/galley/169/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"We thank Simon De Deyne, Paul Égré, James Hampton, Tom Heyman, Lorna Morrow, and Anne White for helpful suggestions.

A Pupillometric Examination of Cognitive Control in Taxonomic and Thematic Semantic Memory,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.56,"Semantic cognition includes taxonomic and thematic relationships, as well as control systems to retrieve and manipulate semantic knowledge to suit specific tasks or contexts. A recent report (Thompson et al., 2017) suggested that retrieving thematic relationships (i.e., relations based on participation in the same event or scenarios) requires more effort or cognitive control, especially when the relevant relations are weak, than retrieving identity relations that are based on sensory-motor features. It is not clear whether the same contrast applies to the broader set of taxonomic relations, which are also based on shared sensory-motor features. In this study we tested cognitive control requirements of retrieving taxonomic and thematic knowledge using a physiological measure of cognitive effort: pupil dilation. Participants completed a semantic relatedness judgement task that manipulated semantic type (thematic vs. taxonomic) and relatedness strength (high vs. low) of word pairs. Cognitive control in the similarity task was examined using task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs), as well as standard behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy). Compared with high-strength relations, low-strength semantic relations elicited larger TERPs, slower reaction times, and lower accuracy, consistent with higher control demands. Compared to thematic relations, taxonomic relations also elicited larger TERPs and slower reaction times, suggesting that retrieving taxonomic relations required more cognitive effort. Critically, our pupillometric data indicated that controlled processing was particularly important for low-strength taxonomic pairs rather than low-strength thematic pairs. These findings indicate that semantic control demands are primarily determined by relatedness strength, not whether the relationship is taxonomic or thematic.","Semantics, Cognitive Control, Memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.56/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.56/galley/126/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,This research was supported by University of Alabama at Birmingham. We thank Sam Castillo for help with data collection.,"Word pairs were selected from a prior norming study (Landrigan and Mirman, 2016). In short, each pair was rated on a 7-point scale for its taxonomic similarity (sharing similar features and/or belonging to the same category) and its thematic relatedness (co-occurrence in common events). To be included in the current study, the pairs had to show a clear dichotomy in terms of the taxonomic and thematic relationships: taxonomic pairs had to have higher taxonomic similarity than thematic relatedness, and thematic pairs had to have higher thematic relatedness than taxonomic similarity. High strength pairs were selected to ensure relatively distinctive relations (taxonomic-thematic rating difference > 1.75) and weak non-dominant relation strength (mean rating ≤ 3.5). Low strength pairs were selected to exhibit a weaker dominant relationship (dominant relationship rating ≤ 4.5; taxonomic-thematic rating difference 0.5–1.75). These criteria ensured that weak pairs still exhibited a distinction in terms of their relationships but one that was weaker than the strong pairs both in terms of the distinction between taxonomic and thematic relatedness and weaker in terms of the dominant relationship rating. Because the non-dominant relationships were very weak for all word pairs, the relatedness judgment task was expected to be performed on the basis of the dominant relationship, which was substantially stronger for the high-strength pairs than for the low-strength pairs. Filler trials were constructed using 64 unrelated word pairs. These pairs did not share similar features, did not belong to the same category, did not co-occur in common events, and were not associated according to the South Florida free association norms (Nelson, McEvoy, & Schreiber, 1998).

"The Danger of Testing by Selecting Controlled Subsets, with Applications to Spoken-Word Recognition",2019,Methods note,2,1,10.5334/joc.51,"When examining the effects of a continuous variable x on an outcome y, a researcher might choose to dichotomize on x, dividing the population into two sets—low x and high x—and testing whether these two subpopulations differ with respect to y. Dichotomization has long been known to incur a cost in statistical power, but there remain circumstances in which it is appealing: an experimenter might use it to control for confounding covariates through subset selection, by carefully choosing a subpopulation of Low and a corresponding subpopulation of High that are balanced with respect to a list of control variables, and then comparing the subpopulations’ y values. This “divide, select, and test” approach is used in many papers throughout the psycholinguistics literature, and elsewhere. Here we show that, despite the apparent innocuousness, these methodological choices can lead to erroneous results, in two ways. First, if the balanced subsets of Low and High are selected in certain ways, it is possible to conclude a relationship between x and y not present in the full population. Specifically, we show that previously published conclusions drawn from this methodology—about the effect of a particular lexical property on spoken-word recognition—do not in fact appear to hold. Second, if the balanced subsets of Low and High are selected randomly, this methodology frequently fails to show a relationship between x and y that is present in the full population. Our work uncovers a new facet of an ongoing research effort: to identify and reveal the implicit freedoms of experimental design that can lead to false conclusions.","Auditory word processing, Word processing, Statistical analysis, Speech perception, Mathematical modelling",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.51/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.51/galley/117/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,We are grateful to Mitchell Sommers and John Morton for generously providing the SWR data. Carleton College supported this work.,"SWR data were collected using standard methods. Stimuli were recorded by a native English speaker with a standard Midwestern American accent in a double-walled sound-attenuating chamber and leveled to total RMS in Adobe Audition. Participants were native English speakers who reported normal hearing and vision, recruited from the Washington University in St. Louis subject pool. Informed consent was obtained from participants and the research was approved by the Institutional Review Board where the SWR data were collected. Subsets of a list of 1120 monosyllabic words were presented to 94 participants (such that each word was presented to 30–32 participants), who attempted to identify the words by typing them. Word order was randomized. Stimuli were presented through headphones using E-Prime in six-talker babble at signal-to-noise ratio of –5. Both homophones and unambiguous nonwords whose obvious phonology matched the correct orthography (e.g., “turse” for “terse”) but no other deviations in spelling (e.g., pluralizations) were scored as correct. Starting from the correct/incorrect tags from the original dataset, we manually flipped a small number of correct/incorrect designations based on the identical-pronunciation criterion, changing a total of 362 participant–stimulus pairs out of 33510, less than 1.1% of the data. (To ensure these changes did not systematically affect the outcomes, we also ran all of our analyses on the uncorrected data; the results were nearly identical to those reported here.) Of the 1120 words used as stimuli, 38 were not consonant-vowel-consonant words and 1 (“bass”) was pronounced differently than its form in the English Lexicon Project (ELP; Balota et al., 2007), the dataset we use to calculate lexical characteristics. Thus, the analyses reported here were conducted on the remaining 1081 words, referred to here as the SWR1081 dataset. The dataset and all code necessary to run our analyses is available online through the Open Science Framework at: https://osf.io/x73dy/. In all analyses, including the integer linear program (ILP) in Figure 2(c), we use the z-scores of each numerical field (e.g., word frequency, number of competitors, clustering coefficient, accuracy) with respect to the full SWR1081 dataset. This choice puts all variables on comparable scales. However, for ease of interpretation, Figure 1 and 2(b) show the raw numbers in the dataset. Figure 1 Maximizing the apparent positive and negative effect of an explanatory variable on SWR accuracy. Each panel shows all 1081 words in SWR1081, plotting for each word w an explanatory variable against the response variable accuracy, the fraction of participants who correctly identified this word when it was presented in a noisy environment. The explanatory variables are (A) the log frequency of w in a large corpus of natural text (Brysbaert & New, 2009), (B) the number of competitors of w in the ELP lexicon (Balota et al., 2007), and (C) the clustering coefficient of w in the ELP lexicon. (Every word in SWR1081 has at least three competitors, so clustering coefficient is well defined.) Each panel identifies two pairs of 50-word subsets {A1, B1} (blue; positive effect) and {A2, B2} (red; negative effect). Each pair of color-matched subsets controls for all explanatory variables in previous panels: in (B), Ai and Bi’s average frequency (in z-score) differ by less than δ = 0.05, and likewise in (C) for both average frequency and number of competitors. Among all such δ-balanced 50-element subsets, the displayed subsets show the largest possible difference (positive and negative) in y for low-x and high-x words. (See Supplementary  for how these subsets are computed.)

Enumeration and Alertness in Developmental Dyscalculia,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.55,"Enumeration, the ability to report an amount of elements, differs as a function of range. Subitizing (quantities 1–4) is an accurate and quick process with reaction times (RTs) minimally affected by the number of presented elements within its range. In the counting range (range of 5–9 elements), RTs increase linearly. Subitizing was considered to be a pre-attentive process for many years. However, recently we found that subitizing could be facilitated by improving engagement of attention. Specifically, brief alerting cues increase attentional engagement and reduced RTs in the subitizing range. Moreover, previous studies found that students with developmental dyscalculia (DD) have a smaller than normal subitizing range (3 vs. 4) and their alerting attentional system is impaired. In the current study, we explored whether an alerting cue would increase the subitizing range of adults suffering from DD from 3 to 4. For controls, alerting increased accuracy rates and facilitated enumeration of quantities only in the subitizing range. Participants with DD presented a larger alerting effect; an alerting cue enhanced their RTs in all ranges, but did not increase their smaller than normal subitizing range or accuracy. Our results suggest that both domain-general and domain-specific abilities contribute to the mechanism of enumeration and related to developmental dyscalculia.","Attention, Numerical cognition, Spatial cognition",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.55/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.55/galley/124/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement 295644.,NA,https://doi.org/10.5334/joc.55.s1,Data of the experiment will appear in an open preservation repository.

We Need a Taxonomy of Working Memory,2019,Commentaries,2,1,10.5334/joc.71,"A vast and diverse literature describes the relationship between working memory and attention. That literature encompasses tests of the interactions between the two functions, comparisons of the processes underlying them, and theoretical formulations of the cognitive constructs. In a recent review, Oberauer (2019) reins in this varied work to create a roadmap for future research. Here, I delineate several additional considerations to guide the evaluation and development of research into working memory and attention. Namely, working memory is a complex construct that can entail many processes and take on several meanings. Research and theory about working memory—and its relation to attention—must consider what particular demands are being tapped, what type of information is being operated on, and what goal is ultimately at stake.","Working memory, Attention, Cognitive Control",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.71/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.71/galley/193/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Award F32MH111204.,NA,134,68
Instructed and Acquired Contingencies in Response-Inhibition Tasks,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.53,"Inhibitory control can be triggered directly via the retrieval of previously acquired stimulus-stop associations from memory. However, a recent study suggests that this item-specific stop learning may be mediated via expectancies of the contingencies in play (Best, Lawrence, Logan, McLaren, & Verbruggen, 2016). This could indicate that stimulus-stop learning also induces strategic proactive changes in performance. We further tested this hypothesis in the present study. In addition to measuring expectancies following task completion, we introduced a between-subjects expectancy manipulation in which one group of participants were informed about the stimulus-stop contingencies and another group did not receive any information about the stimulus-stop contingencies. Moreover, we combined this instruction manipulation with a distractor manipulation that was previously used to examine strategic proactive adjustments. We found that the stop-associated items slowed responding in both conditions. Furthermore, participants in both conditions generated expectancies following task completion that were consistent with the stimulus-stop contingencies. The distractor manipulation was ineffective. However, we found differences in the relationship between the expectancy ratings and task performance: in the instructed condition, the expectancies reliably correlated with the response slowing for the stop-associated items, whereas in the uninstructed condition we found no reliable correlation. These differences between the correlations were reliable, and our conclusions were further supported by Bayesian analyses. We conclude that stimulus-stop associations that are acquired either via task instructions or via task practice have similar effects on behaviour but could differ in how they elicit response slowing.","Cognitive control, Executive functions, Learning",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.53/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.53/galley/122/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,"https://osf.io/kydw6/?view_only=131cbcc73fce4abfbfc34375819ecaad, https://osf.io/kydw6/?view_only=131cbcc73fce4abfbfc34375819ecaad",All data files and analysis scripts are deposited in the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/kydw6/?view_only=131cbcc73fce4abfbfc34375819ecaad).,https://osf.io/kydw6/?view_only=131cbcc73fce4abfbfc34375819ecaad,The additional file for this article can be found as follows: Supplementary Material Descriptive and inferential statistics for Experiment 1 and 2.

Cognitive Measures and Performance on the Antisaccade Eye Movement Task,2019,Research article,2,1,10.5334/joc.52,"The antisaccade (AS) task is considered a prominent measure of inhibitory control, but it is still unclear which cognitive processes are used for successful performance of the task. Previous results have provided evidence for the involvement of several processes, including working memory (WM), inhibition and attention. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore, using a range of neuropsychological tests, which cognitive factors predict individual differences in AS performance. To do so, 143 healthy participants underwent a battery including tests measuring inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, sustained attention, IQ and fluency. Hierarchical stepwise regression analyses were conducted to assess the association with AS performance. Performance on the Trail-Making-Test, version B (TMT-B), a test measuring flexibility, divided attention and WM, was found to significantly predict AS latency. Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP), used to assess sustained attention and WM, significantly predicted AS error rate. Other cognitive measures, however, did not significantly predict AS performance. Bayesian Model Averaging supported these conclusions and showed that non-significant predictors are unlikely to be associated with AS outcomes. Several explanations are provided for the associations of TMT-B and RVIP with AS performance; as the tests measure a range of different cognitive processes, interpretation of these results remains less clear. For a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying AS performance, future research should make use of a wider range of attention and WM tests.","eye movements, working memory, attention, cognitive control",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.52/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.52/galley/119/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,The data from the study are part of a larger study by deCODE genetics.

Fluctuations of Attention and Working Memory,2019,Commentaries,2,1,10.5334/joc.70,"Attention and working memory are intricately related, yet there remain ambiguities in how to best characterize this relationship. In his review, Oberauer formalizes several dimensions for the relationship between attention and working memory, focusing especially on the supporting role of attention during working memory maintenance. In this commentary, we highlight how attention and working memory relate on a broader time scale via trial-to-trial fluctuations. Specifically, we briefly describe evidence and implications of these fluctuations of attention and working memory. A strong link has been shown behaviorally (e.g., interleaved sustained attention and working memory tasks) and neurally (e.g., pre-trial predictors of working memory success), yet fluctuations of attention and working memory are also distinct. Thus, we argue that attention and working memory fluctuate synchronously but not synonymously.","Attention, Working memory, Short-term memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.70/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.70/galley/189/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,K.A. was supported by NIH grant T32 MH020002.

The Flexible Nature of the Interaction Between Attention and Working Memory,2019,Commentaries,2,1,10.5334/joc.68,"In the research literature, attention and working memory are often intimately linked. In his excellent target article, Oberauer concludes that attention is not a necessary requirement for working memory maintenance. In our reply, we argue that attention is an emergent property of maintaining the current task goal. Humans can flexibly transfer the storage of information between different states and different memory systems as the need arises. Only information in service of currently active task goals requires attentional resources for maintenance. In this state, memoranda can bias behavior and are susceptible to interference from additional attention demanding tasks.","Working memory, Attention, Action",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.68/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.68/galley/185/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,107,51
On the Role of Attention in Working Memory for Response Selection in Task Switching,2019,Commentaries,2,1,10.5334/joc.69,"Oberauer’s (2019) analysis and related research on how working memory and attention are linked can provide insight regarding how responses are selected in task-switching situations. One mechanism for response selection—the mediated route—categorizes stimuli with respect to both tasks, then activates responses based on instructed category–response associations. The author discusses two proposals for how these associations are represented in working memory, both of which seem consistent with the idea that attention selects or prioritizes the relevant-task associations, enabling accurate response selection. A broader implication of the representation and operation of the mediated route is that nominal task switching might reflect concurrent multitasking within the cognitive system (constrained by attention in working memory), raising the issue of how task switching should be characterized.","Attention, Working memory, Cognitive control, Executive functions",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.69/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.69/galley/191/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,82,36
Augmented Modality Exclusivity Norms for Concrete and Abstract Italian Property Words,2019,Material development report,2,1,10.5334/joc.88,"How perceptual information is encoded into language and conceptual knowledge is a debated topic in cognitive (neuro)science. We present modality norms for 643 Italian adjectives, which referred to one of the five perceptual modalities or were abstract. Overall, words were rated as mostly connected to the visual modality and least connected to the olfactory and gustatory modality. We found that words associated to visual and auditory experience were more unimodal compared to words associated to other sensory modalities. A principal components analysis highlighted a strong coupling between gustatory and olfactory information in word meaning, and the tendency of words referring to tactile experience to also include information from the visual dimension. Abstract words were found to encode only marginal perceptual information, mostly from visual and auditory experience. The modality norms were augmented with corpus–based (e.g., Zipf Frequency, Orthographic Levenshtein Distance 20) and ratings–based psycholinguistic variables (Age of Acquisition, Familiarity, Contextual Availability).

Prioritizing Targets and Minimizing Distraction Within Limited Capacity Working Memory,2019,Commentaries,2,1,10.5334/joc.75,"Oberauer (2019) maps out different perspectives that have emerged in exploring working memory and attention, and suggests particular ways in which these key aspects of cognition might operate in the service of successful goal completion. One question that is central to Oberauer’s review and to the field more generally concerns how automatic and controlled attention interact with each other and with working memory. In line with this, recent research indicates that both forms of attention can operate within the same task to determine whether information is maintained in working memory. Perceptual attention can be automatically captured by environmental input, resulting in superior recall for the most recent stimulus, along with unwanted disruption by distracting stimuli. Effortful top-down control, powered by executive resources, operates within this context to create and maintain task goals, and to support the maintenance of target information in an accessible state, particularly if it is of greater value/goal relevance.","Working memory, Attention, Short-term memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.75/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.75/galley/187/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1222,38

The rest of the identical cognates were selected from other published research articles (see Table 1). Of the 61 identical cognates selected from Dijkstra et al. (2010) and Tokowicz et al. (2002), we discarded all items with a meaning similarity rating that was less than 6 on their 7-point scales. We also discarded any items with a frequency in Dutch or English that was less than 2 occurrences per million according to the SUBTLEX-NL (Keuleers, Brysbaert, & New, 2010) and SUBTLEX-US (Brysbaert & New, 2009)3 databases and one item that had a mean lexical decision accuracy of less than 85% in the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007). Finally, we discarded any items that were only identical in form when inflected (e.g. “pure”–“pure”, where “pure” in Dutch is the inflected form of the adjective “puur”). Table 1 Experiment 1 & 2. Published articles from which we selected many of the identical cognates and interlingual homographs that were rated in the two experiments. The first column lists the sources of identical cognates for the first experiment. The second column lists the sources of identical interlingual homographs for the second experiment.

We again selected only items that had received a meaning similarity rating greater than 6 on the 7-point scales used by Dijkstra et al. (2010) and Tokowicz et al. (2002). Furthermore, for the set of non-identical cognates, we selected only items with a score greater than 0.5 but less than 1 on an objective measure of orthographic overlap, which we calculated using the formula proposed by Schepens, Dijkstra, and Grootjens (2012): we divided the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) between the Dutch and English written forms of the word by the number of letters of the longest form of the word and subtracted this from 1. We also required that their form similarity rating (Tokowicz et al., 2002) or average orthography-phonology similarity rating (Dijkstra et al., 2010) was above 5. (Because Tokowicz et al. (2002) had asked their participants to take both spelling and pronunciation into account for a single ‘form similarity’ rating, we calculated an average of the orthographic and phonological similarity ratings items had received in the Dijkstra et al. (2010) study, to be more comparable to Tokowicz et al.’s (2002) form similarity rating.). The 444 translation equivalents had objective orthographic overlap scores of less than 0.5 and form similarity ratings (Tokowicz et al., 2002) or average of orthography-phonology similarity ratings (Dijkstra et al., 2010) of less than 3. All English forms of the items had a mean lexical decision accuracy in the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007) greater than 85%. Because the identical cognates generally had lower frequency-of-use values than the non-identical cognates and translation equivalents, items with high frequency-of-use values were discarded. Similarly, the identical cognates were less orthographically complex than the non-identical cognates and translation equivalents, so items with a high OLD20 in either Dutch or English were excluded. A word’s OLD20 value is calculated as its mean orthographic Levenshtein distance to a its 20 closest neighbours (Yarkoni, Balota, & Yap, 2008). Finally, offensive words and items that could belong to more than one word type were excluded (e.g. the Dutch word “brood” is a non-identical cognate of the English word “bread”, but also an identical interlingual homograph of the English word “brood”). After this second step in the selection procedure, a total of 65 identical cognates, 102 non-identical cognates and 315 translation equivalents remained. To determine the final set of stimuli to be rated, we let the software package Match (Van Casteren & Davis, 2007) select the 80 non-identical cognates and 80 translation equivalents that best matched the 65 identical cognates. Matching was based on log-transformed word frequency, word length and OLD20 in both Dutch and English. Note that, because Tokowicz et al.’s (2002) aim was to collect translation norms, many of the translation equivalents and some of the non-identical cognates appeared more than once in Tokowicz et al.’s (2002) materials with different translations (e.g. “afval”–“trash” and “afval”–“waste”). We manually made sure no word form was selected by Match twice. Table 2 lists means, minimums, maximums and standard deviations per word type for each of the matching measures (and raw word frequency) for both English and Dutch. Table 2 Experiment 1 & 2. Means (and standard deviations) and minimum and maximum values for the Dutch and English characteristics and orthographic similarity measure for the 65 identical cognates, 80 non-identical cognates, 87 identical interlingual homographs and 80 translation equivalents rated across both experiments. Frequency refers to the word’s SUBTLEX frequency in occurrences per million [see Keuleers et al. (2010) for Dutch and Brysbaert & New (2009) for English]; log10(frequency) refers to the SUBTLEX log-transformed raw word frequency [log10(raw frequency+1)]; OLD20 refers to Yarkoni et al.’s (2008) measure of orthographic complexity of a word, expressed as its mean orthographic Levenshtein distance to its 20 closest neighbours; orthographic similarity refers to the measure of objective orthographic similarity discussed in the text (measured on a scale from 0 to 1), which was calculated as the Levenshtein distance between the Dutch and English forms of the words divided by the length of the longest of the two forms.

In this experiment, the participants would first read Dutch sentences that contained one of the items. Therefore, the next step involved writing the Dutch sentences for the selected items (see Table 3 for example sentences). The sentences were between 6 and 12 words long and were written so that the target word was placed as far towards the end of the sentence as possible, as this minimises ambiguity. Each target word appeared only in its own sentence and not in any other sentence and only in its uninflected form (e.g. nouns were not pluralised). For nine of the non-identical cognates and 21 of the translation equivalents that Match selected, it was difficult to write a clear and concise sentence that complied with all of these criteria. These items were manually replaced with more suitable items of a similar frequency, length and OLD20. Table 3 Experiment 1 & 2. Examples of items for each of the word types and the Dutch sentence that provided a context for the word (with English translations). The non-identical interlingual homographs only served as fillers in these experiments. The catch items were included to determine whether the participants were carefully reading the sentences. During the experiments, the participants were only shown the Dutch sentence (with the Dutch word form, as here, marked in bold) and the English word form. Dutch word form English word form Sentence (Dutch original) Sentence (English translation) identical cognate wolf wolf De hond is een gedomesticeerde ondersoort van de wolf. The dog is a domesticated subspecies of the wolf. non-identical cognate kat cat Haar ouders hebben een dikke, grijze kat. Her parents have a fat, grey cat. translation equivalent wortel carrot Een ezel kun je altijd blij maken met een wortel. You can always make a donkey happy with a carrot. identical interlingual homograph angel angel Alleen vrouwelijke bijen en wespen hebben een angel. Only female bees and wasps have a sting. non-identical interlingual homograph brutaal brutal Als klein meisje was ze behoorlijk brutaal. When she was a little girl she was quite cheeky. catch item vorst frost Een andere aanduiding voor monarch is vorst. A different term for monarch is sovereign. Finally, to ensure that the participants would make full use of the rating scale for all three aspects—meaning, spelling and pronunciation similarity—across all items, 40 identical interlingual homographs and 21 non-identical interlingual homographs were selected from Poort et al. (2016) and a list on Wikipedia (Wikipedia, 2014). We selected only words that were between 3 and 8 letters long. Any items for which either the Dutch or English frequency was less than 2 occurrences per million or more than 700 were discarded, as well as all items that belonged to more than one word type4 and items for which it was difficult to write a clear and concise Dutch sentence. This left 31 identical and 14 non-identical interlingual homograph pairs to serve as fillers in the first experiment. The sentences for these items were written according to the same criteria as for the identical and non-identical cognates and the translation equivalents. A native speaker of Dutch then proofread all 270 sentences for both the targets and fillers and suggested corrections and clarifications where necessary.",NA,"The database can be accessed at http://osf.io/tcdxb/.

"Within-Subject Performance on a Real-Life, Complex Task and Traditional Lab Experiments: Measures of Word Learning, Raven Matrices, Tapping, and CPR",2019,Data report,2,1,10.5334/joc.65,"In this data report, we describe a three-session experiment spanning six months. Several well-controlled laboratory tasks (Word Learning, Raven Matrices, and Tapping) and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), a complex but well-defined real-world task, were administered. Data are reported from 50 participants for the first session, 40 for the second, and 34 for the third. CPR is a useful domain for studying real-world performance inside the laboratory because clear performance standards can be applied to quantifying learners’ proficiency covering both the first steps that need to be taken prior to the initiation of CPR (declarative knowledge) as well as the compressions and ventilations themselves (procedural skill). This research resulted in a rich dataset with a range of different measures for all participants. For all tasks, the complete set of raw data are made available along with relevant aggregate performance scores (see https://osf.io/m8bxe/). The raw data in particular will enable other researchers to explore potential analyses and modeling beyond the scope of our own.

Preregistered Replication of the Auditory Deviant Effect: A Robust Benchmark Finding,2019,Data report,2,1,10.5334/joc.64,"Short-term memory of visually presented lists of items is disrupted by auditory distraction. The auditory deviant effect refers to the finding that a sequence in which a single auditory event deviates from all other auditory objects disrupts serial recall more than a sequence without such a deviant. The changing-state effect refers to the finding that auditory changing-state sequences with changes from one auditory distractor item to the next disrupt the immediate serial recall of verbal items more than steady-state sequences consisting of distractor repetitions. One purpose of the present study is to perform a preregistered replication of the auditory deviant effect as well as (for the purpose of comparison) the changing-state effect and to provide reference data sets for the auditory deviant effect and the changing-state effect in the benchmarks repository with a large sample of participants and trials. Both effects were robustly obtained over the course of two sessions in which participants were tested. We also explored the relationship between auditory distraction and personality, and found auditory distraction to be unrelated to extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism.","Working memory, Short-term memory, Attention",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.64/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.64/galley/155/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,We acknowledge support by the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf.,"A standard serial recall paradigm was used (see, for example, Röer et al., 2015). Participants were seated in separate cubicles with sound-absorbing walls in sessions with up to five participants. The instructions emphasized that anything presented over the headphones was to be ignored. Participants started each trial by pressing the space bar. After a 1000 ms blank screen, eight digits (randomly sampled without replacement from the set {1, 2, …, 9} were successively presented at the center of the screen, each for 1000 ms, in 80 pt Monaco font. Then eight question marks appeared on the screen that had to be replaced by the digits. Participants used the number pad of the keyboard to enter the recalled digits in forward order. They were not allowed to correct their responses. To motivate participants to concentrate on the task, they received feedback about how many digits they had remembered correctly after each trial. A digit was only scored as correctly recalled when it was entered at the correct serial position. During the encoding of the digits, three types of auditory distractor sequences had to be ignored. In the steady-state condition, the same word was repeated 10 times (e.g., Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg). In the auditory deviant condition, the steady-state sequence was disrupted by a deviant word presented at the 7th position (e.g., Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Berg, Chef, Berg, Berg, Berg). In the changing-state condition, ten different words were presented (e.g., Dank, Berg, Zeug, Chef, Wind, Gold, Typ, Ruf, Haut, Mund). The distractors were played for 500 ms with a 300 ms inter-distractor-interval. In all conditions, the distractors were randomly drawn from the set {Berg, Chef, Dank, Gold, Haut, Hof, Mund, Rand, Ruf, Typ, Wind, Zeug}. All words were spoken by the same female voice. The distractors were played at about 65 dB(A) through headphones with high-insulation hearing protection covers (beyerdynamic DT-150) that were plugged directly into the Apple iMacs that controlled the experiment. The software used for this purpose was written in LiveCode.1 Following 16 steady-state training trials (which were not to be analyzed), the experimental trials (consisting of 8 steady-state trials, 8 auditory deviant trials, and 8 changing-state trials) followed in random order. This procedure was chosen because it closely resembles that of previous studies conducted in our lab in which the auditory deviant effect was robustly obtained (Röer et al., 2015; Röer, Körner, Buchner, & Bell, 2018). We only used 8 trials in each condition because it has been observed that the auditory deviant effect decreases over trials (Röer et al., 2015, 2018). We thus refrained from using more trials per session. It could have decreased the chances of finding a significant effect if the study had provided more opportunity for habituation. To nevertheless ensure that the data set included a large number of trials, we decided to invite the participants to take part in a second session in the subsequent week in which the experiment described above was repeated in the exact same way. Including two sessions with a large number of trials has many advantages for the usefulness of the data in statistical modeling (Oberauer et al., 2018) and allows to examine whether the measures are robustly observed. At the end of each session, the participants completed the Eysenck personality questionnaire EPQ-R (Ruch, 1999).",NA,The raw data are available in the benchmarks repository at https://osf.io/g49c6/.

Differences in Auditory Distraction between Adults and Children: A Duplex-mechanism Approach,2018,Review article,1,1,10.5334/joc.15,"Differences in the impact of irrelevant sound on recall performance in children (aged 7–9 years old; N = 89) compared to adults (aged 18–22 years old; N = 89) were examined. Tasks that required serial rehearsal (serial and probed-order recall tasks) were contrasted with one that did not (the missing-item task) in the presence of irrelevant sound that was either steady-state (a repeated speech token), changing-state (two alternating speech tokens) and, for the first time with a child sample, could also contain a deviant token (a male-voice token embedded in a sequence otherwise spoken in a female voice). Participants either completed tasks in which the to-be-remembered list-length was adjusted to individual digit span or was fixed at one item greater than the average span we observed for the age-group. The disruptive effects of irrelevant sound did not vary across the two methods of determining list-length. We found that tasks encouraging serial rehearsal were especially affected by changing-state sequences for both age-groups (i.e., the changing-state effect) and there were no group differences in relation to this effect. In contrast, disruption by a deviant sound—generally assumed to be the result of attentional diversion—was evident among children in all three tasks while adults were less susceptible to this effect. This pattern of results suggests that developmental differences in distraction are due to differences in attentional control rather than serial rehearsal efficiency.","Attention, Cognitive Control, Development of cognition, Working memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.15/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.15/galley/30/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"All tasks were run on a desktop computer (Belinea BB10002) or laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad E560) using E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools). The screen size (and resolution) was 17"" (1920 × 1080 pixels) and 15.6"" (1280 × 1024), respectively, for the desktop and laptop computers. Sennheiser HD-202 headphones were used to present the auditory sequences. To-Be-Remembered Lists. The to-be-remembered items for all tasks were drawn from the set 0–9. The digit sequence for each trial was randomly generated using MATLAB, ensuring that digits were sampled without replacement and with the constraint that no sequence had three or more consecutive digits in ascending or descending order (e.g., …4, 3, 2…). Each to-be-remembered item appeared in black 72 point Arial font on a white background for 1000 ms with no inter-stimulus interval. Irrelevant Sound Sequences. The sound sequences were recorded using a broadcast quality Dictaphone in a sound attenuated chamber and then edited using Sony Sound Forge Pro 11 software (Sony Creative Software). Four spoken items were recorded with a 16-bit resolution and a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz. These were the letters ‘A’ and ‘B’ in both a female and a male voice. These were then digitally edited to 250 ms and used to construct four types of sound sequence: changing-state (ABAB…or BABA…all in a female voice), steady-state (AAAA… or BBBB…all in a female voice), a changing-state sequence with one of the female-spoken items replaced with a ‘deviant’ male-spoken item (e.g., ABABA…; male-spoken item shown in bold) and a deviant male-spoken item within a steady-state sequence (e.g., AAAAA…). In each sequence, there was a 500 ms inter-stimulus interval and there were two sound tokens per to-be-remembered item. The onset of the first sound coincided with that of the first to-be-remembered item. For with-deviant trials, the deviant occurred either exactly or as close as possible to 5/8ths of the way through the to-be-remembered list (cf. Hughes et al., 2013) regardless of list-length. For example, with a list-length of 8, the deviant was the 10th out of the 16 sounds in the sequence, with a list-length of 5, the deviant was the 6th out of 10 sounds, and with a list-length of 4 the deviant was the 5th of 8 sounds. A quiet condition was also included, making a total of five auditory conditions. Sounds were played at approximately 55 dB(A) as measured with a sound level meter and an earphone coupler. Recall Tasks Digit span test. The digit span test was used to assess a participant’s verbal short-term memory capacity. Participants were shown digits on screen and were required to recall them in the order they were presented. There were three trials of each set-size ranging from three to nine items (taken without replacement from the set 0–9). An individual’s digit span was determined as the last set size at which all items were correctly recalled in order on at least two of the three trials (testing stopped for a given participant at this point also). Serial recall. Participants were shown a list of digits drawn from 0–8 on screen at the rate of one digit every second. Following the last item, the possible response candidates for that list were presented in canonical order and participants were required to click on the digits in the order they had been presented. There was no time-limit on recall and the cue for the next trial (‘Begin’) appeared when all the response boxes were filled. Participants clicked on ‘Begin’ to commence to the next trial. Probed-order recall task. In this task, digit presentation was identical to the serial recall task but at the end of the list the question ‘Which number followed x in the list?’ was displayed for 1000 ms, where x could be any of the just-presented items (except the last one). This was followed by the canonical digit array. Once the response was made, the word ‘Begin’ appeared for participants to click to initiate the next trial. Missing-item task. In this task, participants were instructed that a fixed list of digits would be shown on screen (e.g., digits from 0–5) and that one digit would be missing from this list on each trial. Their task was to identify the missing digit. At the end of each list, the question ‘Which number was missing from the list?’ was displayed on the screen for 1000 ms followed by the digits from the relevant set presented in a canonically ordered array. Each digit was missing roughly an equal number of times. After the response was made, the word ‘Begin’ appeared for participants to initiate the next trial.",NA,Data are accessible from DOI: https://doi.org/10.17030/uclan.data.00000150,https://doi.org/10.17030/uclan.data.00000150,NA,NA,NA,NA,396,122
The Relation Between Memory Speed and Capacity: A Domain-General Law of Human Cognition?,2019,Registered report,2,1,10.5334/joc.83,"This study tests an important and appealing hypothesis that has been around in the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience for over 40 years, but that lacks a conclusive empirical test. According to this hypothesis, there is a direct relationship between speed and capacity in working memory. Working memory refers to the ability to retain a small amount of information in a highly accessible state for a short period of time. Across different fields, it has been proposed that the limited capacity of working memory can be understood in terms of time instead of space, such that the amount of information that can be actively maintained corresponds to the amount of information through which one can cycle in a constant and relatively short time-window. Here, we present a study that explicitly and directly tests the speed-capacity hypothesis. In particular, we test (1) the speed-capacity hypothesis in verbal working memory, (2) the speed-capacity hypothesis in visuospatial working memory, and most importantly, (3) whether the same speed-capacity relation holds across verbal and visuospatial working memory, reflecting a domain-general, time-based law of human working memory capacity and, as such, of the complexity of human thought. Overall, our results do not provide any evidence for the existence of a domain-general law. However, unexpected findings related to measuring memory speed (i.e., high prevalence of negative search slopes in the Sternberg task) prevent us from drawing firm conclusions.","Working memory, Attention, Memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.83/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.83/galley/220/download/,"EV is on the editorial board of the Journal of Cognition, a voluntary position.

Do Readers Integrate Phonological Codes Across Saccades? A Bayesian Meta-Analysis and a Survey of the Unpublished Literature,2019,Review article,2,1,10.5334/joc.87,"It is commonly accepted that phonological codes can be activated parafoveally during reading and later used to aid foveal word recognition- a finding known as the phonological preview benefit. However, a closer look at the literature shows that this effect may be less consistent than what is sometimes believed. To determine the extent to which phonology is processed parafoveally, a Bayesian meta-analysis of 27 experiments and a survey of the unpublished literature were conducted. While the results were generally consistent with the phonological preview benefit (>90% probability of a true effect in gaze durations), the size of the effect was small. Readers of alphabetical orthographies obtained a modest benefit of only 4 ms in gaze durations. Interestingly, Chinese readers showed a larger effect (6–14 ms in size). There was no difference in the magnitude of the phonological preview benefit between homophone and pseudo-homophone previews, thus suggesting that the modest processing advantage is indeed related to the activation of phonological codes from the parafoveal word. Simulations revealed that the results are relatively robust to missing studies, although the effects may be 19–22% smaller if all missing studies found a null effect. The results suggest that while phonology can be processed parafoveally, this happens only to a limited extent. Because phonological priming effects in single-word recognition are small (10–13 ms; Rastle & Brysbaert, 2006) and there is a loss of visual acuity in the parafovea, it is argued that large phonological preview benefit effects may be unlikely.","Reading, Eye movements, Attention, Vision, Visual word processing",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.87/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.87/galley/222/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"We thank Joshua Snell, Liz Schotter, and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on a previous version of this manuscript.

The Effect of Stimulus-Response Compatibility on the Association of Fluid Intelligence and Working Memory with Choice Reaction Times,2019,Data report,2,1,10.5334/joc.66,"It is a well-replicated finding that reaction time is correlated with performance in intelligence tests. According to the binding hypothesis of working memory capacity, the ability to establish bindings between elements and to integrate them into new structural representations is the source of the common variance between different cognitive tasks, including fluid intelligence and working memory. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of stimulus-response compatibility on the association between reaction time, fluid intelligence, and working memory. Based on the binding hypothesis, we expected that correlations between reaction time and fluid intelligence would be larger for arbitrary than for compatible stimulus-response mappings. We report data from two studies (Study 1: n = 135, mean age = 18 years; Study 2: n = 153, mean age = 17 years). We used choice reaction time tasks with compatible and arbitrary mappings as well as indicators of fluid intelligence and working memory (Study 1) and fluid and crystallized intelligence (Study 2). In both studies, we established a measurement model that included a factor reflecting general reaction time, and a nested factor reflecting the cost of establishing and maintaining arbitrary stimulus-response bindings. The results of Study 1 supported the hypothesis that the ability to uphold arbitrary bindings is correlated with working memory, but it was not correlated with fluid intelligence. In Study 2, the correlations between the binding factor and fluid and crystallized intelligence were again not significantly different from 0. We discuss possible reasons for these findings.","Response speed, Working memory, Reasoning",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.66/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.66/galley/157/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,We thank Benjamin Goecke for assistance with data preparation.

Working Memory and Attention – A Conceptual Analysis and Review,2019,Review article,2,1,10.5334/joc.58,"There is broad agreement that working memory is closely related to attention. This article delineates several theoretical options for conceptualizing this link, and evaluates their viability in light of their theoretical implications and the empirical support they received. A first divide exists between the concept of attention as a limited resource, and the concept of attention as selective information processing. Theories conceptualizing attention as a resource assume that this resource is responsible for the limited capacity of working memory. Three versions of this idea have been proposed: Attention as a resource for storage and processing, a shared resource for perceptual attention and memory maintenance, and a resource for the control of attention. The first of these three is empirically well supported, but the other two are not. By contrast, when attention is understood as a selection mechanism, it is usually not invoked to explain the capacity limit of working memory – rather, researchers ask how different forms of attention interact with working memory, in two areas. The first pertains to attentional selection of the contents of working memory, controlled by mechanisms of filtering out irrelevant stimuli, and removing no-longer relevant representations from working memory. Within working memory contents, a single item is often selected into the focus of attention for processing. The second area pertains to the role of working memory in cognitive control. Working memory contributes to controlling perceptual attention – by holding templates for targets of perceptual selection – and controlling action – by holding task sets to implement our current goals.","Working memory, Attention, Cognitive Control",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.58/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.58/galley/195/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The work on this article was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF, grant number 100014_135002).

Experiential History as a Tuning Parameter for Attention,2018,Commentaries,1,1,10.5334/joc.25,"[Peer commentary on “Visual selection: usually fast and automatic; seldom slow and volitional,” by J. Theeuwes]. Journal of Cognition. In his current opinion piece, Theeuwes emphasizes the role of selection history as a third source of attentional selection, beyond top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, thus challenging traditional dual-process models of attention. While we agree that selection history impacts the allocation of attention, our own work suggests that this terminology may be too restrictive, and propose the simple term history as a better reflection of the impact of learning on our selection biases. Furthermore, we propose that the role of selection/experiential history on attention may not be as a unique third source of attentional selection, but rather as a tuning parameter, allowing certain categories of item to be endowed with greater task-based or feature-driven salience in a context and history dependent manner. This conceptualization presents an alternative to abandoning dual-process models of attention altogether. Rather, we can reimagine how task-based and feature-driven processes may be controlled by past experience in a dynamic and adaptable system.","Attention, Emotion and cognition, Implicit cognition",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.25/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.25/galley/54/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,The authors have no data accessibility statement to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,170,48
Conducting Web-Based Experiments for Numerical Cognition Research,2019,Review article,2,1,10.5334/joc.85,"It is becoming increasingly popular and straightforward to collect data in cognitive psychology through web-based studies. In this paper, I review issues around web-based data collection for the purpose of numerical cognition research. Provided that the desired type of data can be collected through a web-browser, such online studies offer numerous advantages over traditional forms of physical lab-based data collection, such as gathering data from larger sample sizes in shorter time-windows and easier access to non-local populations. I then present results of two replication studies that employ classical paradigms in numerical cognition research: the number-size congruity paradigm and comparison to a given standard, which also included a masked priming manipulation. In both replications, reaction times and error rates were comparable to original, physical lab-based studies. Consistent with the results of original studies, a distance effect, a congruity effect, and a priming effect were observed. Data collected online thus offers a level of reliability comparable to data collected in a physical lab when it comes to questions in numerical cognition.","Numerical cognition, Response speed, Response accuracy",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.85/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.85/galley/210/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.

The Risks of Downplaying Top-Down Control,2018,Commentaries,1,1,10.5334/joc.26,"Is top-down control necessarily scarce, slow, and hence unimportant in visual selection? Here we outline the risks of downplaying top-down control. Contrary to Theeuwes’ review, we suggest that not all sources of attention map onto a unitary attentional priority map. Goals and search habits may influence where and how people deploy attention, respectively. Because goals have modulatory effects on sensory processing, their impact on attention is broad and not always deliberate. In addition, when multiple sources influence attention, top-down control often dominates over less deliberate forms of attention. We agree with Theeuwes that selection history can drive attention independent of explicit goals. Nonetheless, top-down control remains a cornerstone of visual selection.","Attention, Reward processing, Visual search, Spatial cognition",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.26/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.26/galley/52/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,The authors have no data accessibility statement to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,189,74
Testing the Attentional Dwelling Hypothesis of Attentional Capture,2018,Registered report,1,1,10.5334/joc.48,"Researchers are strongly divided as to whether abrupt onsets capture spatial attention in a purely stimulus-driven fashion or contingent on their search goals. Recently, Gaspelin, Ruthruff and Lien (2016) offered a resolution of this debate by showing that whether spatial capture by abrupt onsets is observed in a spatial cueing search task critically depends on search difficulty. To account for these findings, they proposed an “attentional dwelling” hypothesis, according to which, following capture by a cue, attention dwells at the cued location until the object subsequently appearing at that location is identified as the target or rejected as a distractor. A critical prediction of this account is that the more similar to the target the distractor at the cued location, the longer attention should dwell at its location. Yet, Gaspelin et al. (2016) did not test this prediction because they manipulated overall search difficulty rather than the difficulty of rejecting a specific distractor. The present study provides a critical test of the attentional dwelling hypothesis, by also varying target-distractor similarity within a trial rather than only between trials. Although we closely replicated these authors’ findings, the dwelling hypothesis passed the critical test in one of our two experiments. To accommodate the entire pattern of results observed here, we tentatively suggest a priority-accumulation framework, according to which cue validity effects do not necessarily index spatial shifts of attention, but instead, how much the cue speeds the resolution of the competition between the target and distractors in the search display.","Attention, Visual search, Visual perception",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.48/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.48/galley/99/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Support is provided by the Israel Science Foundation (ISF) grant no. 1286/16 to Dominique Lamy.,NA,369,115
The Manipulability Effect in Object Naming,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.30,"Seeing objects triggers activation of motor areas. The implications of this motor activation in tasks that do not require object-use is still a matter of debate in cognitive sciences. Here we test whether motor activation percolates into the linguistic system by exploring the effect of object manipulability in a speech production task. Italian native speakers name the set of photographs provided by Guérard, Lagacè and Brodeur (Beh Res Meth, 2015). Photographs varied on four motor dimensions concerning on how easily the represented objects can be grasped, moved, or pantomimed, and the number of actions that can be performed with them. The results show classical psycholinguistic phenomena such as the effect of age of acquisition and name agreement in naming latencies. Critically, linear mixed-effects models show an effect of three motor predictors over and above the psycholinguistic effects (replicating, in part, previous findings, Guérard et al., 2015). Further research is needed to address how, and at which level, the manipulability effect emerges in the course of word production.","word production, object manipulability, object naming, lexical access, language production",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.30/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.30/galley/66/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,Data file and analyses have been made publicly via the Open Science Framework and can be accessed at https://osf.io/kuw6s/.,https://osf.io/kuw6s/,NA,NA,NA,NA,185,59

Incidental Counting: Speeded Number Naming Through Finger Movements,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.49,"The first steps in numerical cognition are usually done in conjunction with fingers. Following the assumption that abstract concepts stay associated with the sensory-motor information that was present during their acquisition and consolidation, mental number representations should always be associated with the respective finger counting components. We tested whether finger movements that imply finger counting actually prime the corresponding number concepts in adults. All participants counted number 1 with their thumb and incremented sequentially to number 5 with their pinky. In the experiment, participants sequentially and repeatedly pressed five buttons from thumb to pinky. Each button press triggered the visual presentation of a random number between 1 and 5 that had to be named aloud, resulting in 20% counting-congruent and 80% counting-incongruent finger-number mappings. Average naming latencies were significantly shorter for congruent than incongruent finger-number combinations. Furthermore, there was a distance effect where primes partly co-activated numerically close target numbers and with decreasing priming for more distant prime-target pairs. Overall, these results provide further evidence that number representations are strongly associated with finger counting experience, making fingers an effective tool for number comprehension.","embodied cognition, finger counting, numerical cognition, number naming",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.49/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.49/galley/104/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,The raw data and analysis script are available via the Open Science Framework platform at https://osf.io/nur86.,https://osf.io/nur86,NA,NA,This study was funded by DFG (grant number Fi-1915/2-1 on “Manumerical cognition”).,NA,270,75
Cues to Lying May be Deceptive: Speaker and Listener Behaviour in an Interactive Game of Deception,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.46,"Are the cues that speakers produce when lying the same cues that listeners attend to when attempting to detect deceit? We used a two-person interactive game to explore the production and perception of speech and nonverbal cues to lying. In each game turn, participants viewed pairs of images, with the location of some treasure indicated to the speaker but not to the listener. The speaker described the location of the treasure, with the objective of misleading the listener about its true location; the listener attempted to locate the treasure, based on their judgement of the speaker’s veracity. In line with previous comprehension research, listeners’ responses suggest that they attend primarily to behaviours associated with increased mental difficulty, perhaps because lying, under a cognitive hypothesis, is thought to cause an increased cognitive load. Moreover, a mouse-tracking analysis suggests that these judgements are made quickly, while the speakers’ utterances are still unfolding. However, there is a surprising mismatch between listeners and speakers: When producing false statements, speakers are less likely to produce the cues that listeners associate with lying. This production pattern is in keeping with an attempted control hypothesis, whereby liars may take into account listeners’ expectations and correspondingly manipulate their behaviour to avoid detection.","Deception, Communication, Pragmatics, Disfluency",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.46/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.46/galley/97/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"The stimuli consisted of 96 black-and-white line drawings of objects, presented in fixed pairs across 48 trials.

This was done with the aim of eliciting complex noun phrases from Speakers when naming an object, in order to provide longer utterances for analysis. On each trial, one object within the pair was the target behind which the treasure was hidden, while the other served as a distractor.

Tracking the Dynamics of Mind Wandering: Insights from Pupillometry,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.41,"Mind wandering (MW) refers to the shift of attention away from a primary task towards thoughts unrelated to the task. Here we show that significant new insight into the dynamics of this process can be gained by using pupillometry. Participants performed a monotonous vigilance task which was intermixed with task-irrelevant verbal cues. At fixed times, we interrupted them and asked what they were thinking about immediately prior to the probe and what had triggered their thought. We observed pupil dilation after the presentation of verbal cues reported to have triggered MW, compared with other verbal cues with similar emotional content. Thus, MW is associated with pupil dilation. We also analysed the pupil-constriction response to the task-stimuli (vertical and horizontal bars, to be categorized as targets and non-targets for the vigilance task), and found that this was unchanged during MW. We conclude that pupil size provides an index of MW, objective and covert and that this may be exploited in further studies to understand whether and how MW affects the processing of sensory stimuli.","mind wandering, pupillometry, spontaneous mind wandering, task-unrelated thoughts, task disengagement",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.41/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.41/galley/85/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,Data and analyses scripts are available at osf.io/ywzec.,osf.io/ywzec,The additional file for this article can be found as follows: Appendix A Vigilance Task instructions.

Categorized Affective Pictures Database (CAP-D),2018,Data report,1,1,10.5334/joc.47,"Emotional picture databases are commonly used in emotion research. The databases were first based on ratings of emotional dimensions, and the interest in studying discrete emotions led to the categorization of subsets from these databases to emotional categories. However, to-date, studies that categorized affective pictures used confidence intervals in their analysis, a method that provides important data but also results in a high percentage of blended or undifferentiated categorization of images. The current study used 526 affective pictures from four databases and categorized the pictures to discrete emotions in two steps (Pre-testing phase & Experiment 1). First, clinical psychologists were asked to generate emotional labels for each picture, according to the emotion the picture evoked in them. This resulted in the creation of 10 emotional categories. These labels were presented to students who were asked to choose the emotional category that matched the emotion a presented picture evoked in them. Agreement levels on the emotional categories were calculated for each picture, and pictures were categorized according to the most dominant emotion they evoked. The analysis of agreement levels rather than confidence intervals enabled us to provide both dominance of emotional category and agreement in the population regarding the dominance. In Experiment 2, we asked participants to provide ratings of emotional intensity and arousal, in order to provide more detailed information regarding the database. This is the first study to provide agreement levels on the categorization of affective pictures, and may be useful in various studies which aim at generating specific emotions.","Emotion and cognition, Stimulus development, Categorisation",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.47/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.47/galley/95/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,https://osf.io/b4dms/?view_only=f984c0e2ecd04039ac8cbb40ef61b461,Data files may be downloaded here: https://osf.io/b4dms/?view_only=f984c0e2ecd04039ac8cbb40ef61b461.,https://osf.io/b4dms/?view_only=f984c0e2ecd04039ac8cbb40ef61b461,NA,NA,NA,NA,687,168
How Many Participants Do We Have to Include in Properly Powered Experiments? A Tutorial of Power Analysis with Reference Tables,2019,Review article,2,1,10.5334/joc.72,"Given that an effect size of d = .4 is a good first estimate of the smallest effect size of interest in psychological research, we already need over 50 participants for a simple comparison of two within-participants conditions if we want to run a study with 80% power.

Controlling the Resit Effect by Means of Investment Depreciation,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.40,"In accordance with a rational model of study-time investment, we previously found that the prospect of a resit exam leads to lower investments of fictional study-time for a first exam opportunity in an investment game utilizing simulated exams. In the current study, we investigated whether the depreciation of one’s first-exam investment reduces the resit effect. Specifically, we investigated study-time investments for a simulated multiple-choice exam in which 0, 50, or 100% of the initial study-time investment was lost before the resit exam. In accordance with our predictions, we found that the magnitude of the resit effect decreased as investment depreciation increased. This finding suggests that the negative effect of resit exams on study-time investment may be countered by creating conditions under which investment depreciation (i.e. forgetting) is expected to occur, for instance, by increasing the temporal interval between the first attempt and resit exam.","resit exams, investment decisions, investment depreciation, education, mathematical modeling, rationality",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.40/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.40/galley/81/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"The study-time investment task (Nijenkamp et al., 2016) was programmed in MATLAB and run on computers situated in a room with 5 computer set-ups, which were enclosed by paperboard walls.

A Word on Words in Words: How Do Embedded Words Affect Reading?,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.45,"A surprisingly small portion of reading research has been dedicated to investigating how the visual word recognition process is influenced by embedded words (e.g., ‘arm’ in ‘charm’), and no research has yet investigated embedded words in a natural reading setting. Covering this issue, the present work reports analyses of eye-tracking data from the GECO bilingual book reading corpus. Word viewing times were analyzed as a function of the number, frequency and proportional length of embedded words. We anticipated two scenarios: embedded words would either facilitate processing due to increased word-letter feedback, or inhibit processing due to increased lexical competition. A main facilitatory effect of embedded words on the recognition process was established, with an increasing number of embedded words resulting in shorter word viewing times and fewer fixations. This pattern was depicted by readers of Dutch as well as readers of English. Long, high-frequency embedded words formed an exception however, as these led to inhibition (Dutch participants) or a null-effect (English participants). The present results indicate that both scenarios outlined above are at play, but with a theoretical constraint on the role of word-to-word inhibitory connections. Specifically, such connections may predominantly exist among words of similar length. Hence, embedded words generally facilitate processing through word-letter feedback, but this facilitatory effect is countered by word-to-word inhibition if the embedded word’s length approximates that of its superset.","Reading, Visual word processing, Eye movements",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.45/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.45/galley/93/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,This research was supported by the European Research Council (grant number ERC742141 awarded to Jonathan Grainger) and the Brain & Language Research Institute (ANR-11-LABX-0036).,NA,NA,The corpus data is publicly available at http://expsy.ugent.be/downloads/geco/.,http://expsy.ugent.be/downloads/geco/,NA,NA,NA,NA,384,84
The Impact of Cognitive Load on the Cardiac Orienting Response to Auditory Structural Features during Natural Radio Listening Situations,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.43,"Previous research has shown that structural features such as voice changes, jingle onsets, and production effects in a radio broadcast elicit cardiac orienting responses. In fact, the voice change has been shown to reliably elicit orienting without habituation after several repetitions. However, repeated onsets of two other auditory structural features—jingles and production effects—did result in habituation when the participant was exposed to them embedded in an audio production absent a central cognitive task. This article presents two experiments testing the possibility that adding a central task prevents the development of a robust neural model of the auditory structural features necessary for habituation. In both studies, results show that adding a primary cognitive task eliminated habituation to jingles and production effects. However, varying the cognitive load of the primary task across two levels of difficulty had no significant effect on habituation.","Audio, attention, orienting response, habituation, radio",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.43/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.43/galley/87/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,"http://www.wordjigsaw.com/, http://www.wordjigsaw.com/",Data and analysis files may be downloaded here: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5FDPK.,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5FDPK,NA,NA,NA,NA,315,72
Predicting Lexical Norms: A Comparison between a Word Association Model and Text-Based Word Co-occurrence Models,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.50,"In two studies we compare a distributional semantic model derived from word co-occurrences and a word association based model in their ability to predict properties that affect lexical processing. We focus on age of acquisition, concreteness, and three affective variables, namely valence, arousal, and dominance, since all these variables have been shown to be fundamental in word meaning. In both studies we use a model based on data obtained in a continued free word association task to predict these variables. In Study 1 we directly compare this model to a word co-occurrence model based on syntactic dependency relations to see which model is better at predicting the variables under scrutiny in Dutch. In Study 2 we replicate our findings in English and compare our results to those reported in the literature. In both studies we find the word association-based model fit to predict diverse word properties. Especially in the case of predicting affective word properties, we show that the association model is superior to the distributional model.","word associations, k-nearest neighbors, lexical norms, affective word characteristics, concreteness, age of acquisition",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.50/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.50/galley/106/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,"No new data were collected during this research.

"One Step at a Time: Representational Overlap Between Active Voice, Be-passive, and Get-passive Forms in English",2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.36,"The active voice and passive voice are complementary sentence forms that are available when describing a transitive event. In English, the latter has two variants: be-passive and get-passive. Numerous attempts have been made in the literature to represent the syntactic and semantic differences between these forms, while maintaining their shared features, yet theoretical accounts still differ. At the same time, empirical studies into structural choice have frequently investigated the use of passive voice versus active voice, while the distinction between get- versus be-passive has not received much attention. Here we investigate the degree of similarity between the three transitive variants (be-passive, get-passive, active voice), providing experimental evidence of their mental representations in relation to each other. We describe three experiments in which participants gave acceptability or naturalness ratings for sentences formed with either be-passive or get-passive, and containing one of several adjunct types. Participants were also free to provide an alternative way to phrase each, enabling us to consider whether there are differences in accessing alternatives. We observed overwhelming preferences for changing get-passives into be-passives, and for changing be-passives into active voice, but none for changing get-passives directly into active voice (despite active voice being the most preferred variant). This preference for changing get-passive into be-passive was observed even when a change into active voice was further facilitated by the availability of a ‘ready-made’ agent. These patterns of change are consistent with partial representational overlap along two dimensions described by Thompson et al. (2013): Patient Prominence and Patient Importance. Our findings also contribute to discussions of passive structure by revealing the relative closeness of the mental representations of these forms.","sentence processing, language production, language comprehension, mental representation, passives, syntax",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.36/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.36/galley/76/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number RES-062-23-2009], awarded to Christoph Scheepers and Fernanda Ferreira.

Comparing Pupil Light Response Modulation between Saccade Planning and Working Memory,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.33,"The signature of spatial attention effects has been demonstrated through saccade planning and working memory. Although saccade planning and working memory have been commonly linked to attention, the comparison of effects resulting from saccade planning and working memory is less explored. It has recently been shown that spatial attention interacts with local luminance at the attended location. When bright and dark patch stimuli are presented simultaneously in the periphery, thereby producing no change in global luminance, pupil size is nonetheless smaller when the locus of attention overlaps with the bright, compared to the dark patch stimulus (referred to as the local luminance modulation). Here, we used the local luminance modulation to directly compare the effects of saccade planning and spatial working memory. Participants were required to make a saccade towards a visual target location (visual-delay) or a remembered target location (memory-delay) after a variable delay, and the bright and dark patch stimuli were presented during the delay period between target onset and go signal. Greater pupil constriction was observed when the bright patch, compared to the dark patch, was spatially aligned with the target location in both tasks. However, the effects were diminished when there was no contingency implemented between the patch and target locations, particularly in the memory-delay task. Together, our results suggest the involvement of similar, but not identical, attentional mechanisms through saccade planning and working memory, and highlight a promising potential of local pupil luminance responses for probing visuospatial processing.","attention, saccade preparation, pupil constriction, pupil dilation, arousal",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.33/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.33/galley/72/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"This work was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research Grant (MOP-FDN-148418) and the Canada Research Chair Program to DPM.

All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Board of Queen’s University and were in accordance with the principles of the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS-2 2014) on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 2001). Twenty participants in Experiment 1 (6 + 4 participants in Experiment 2) were recruited for this study (age range = 18 and 35). Participants had normal or corrected to normal vision and were naïve regarding the purpose of the experiment. They provided informed consent and were compensated for their participation. Eye position and pupil size were measured with a video-based eye tracker (Eyelink-1000 binocular-arm, SR Research, Osgoode, ON, Canada) at a rate of 500 Hz with binocular recording (left pupil was mainly used). Stimulus presentation and data acquisition were controlled by Eyelink Experiment Builder and Eyelink software. Stimuli were presented on a 17-inch LCD monitor at a screen resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels (60 Hz refresh rate), subtending a viewing angle of 32° × 26°, with the distance from the eyes to the monitor set at 58 cm. Visual-delay saccade task (Exp 1: Figure 1A). Participants were seated in a dark room, and the experiment consisted of 165 trials. Each trial began with the appearance of a central fixation point (FP) (0.6° diameter; 10 cd/m2, isoluminant color to the background) on a gray background (10 cd/m2). After a period of 800 ms, a peripheral target (1° diameter; isoluminant to the background) appeared in one of 16 possible locations (8 different radial angles at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315°, each at two eccentricities of 4 or 8° visual angle from the central fixation spot). After a variable delay (900–2900 ms), two circular patches (4.5° in diameter, one bright and the other dark, both with 95% contrast relative to the gray background, referred to as the patch stimuli) were displayed for 400 ms. After another variable delay (500–2500 ms), the FP was removed, and participants were required to generate a saccade toward the target. Three types of patch stimulus conditions were used: in the bright condition (20% of trials), the bright patch stimulus location was spatially aligned with the target location and the dark patch was presented at the opposite location of the bright patch. In the dark condition (20% of trials), the dark patch stimulus location was spatially aligned with the target location and the bright patch was presented at the opposite location of the dark patch. In the neutral condition (60% of trials), neither of the patch stimuli locations were spatially aligned with the target location (but the opposite spatial relationship between the two patch stimuli locations was maintained). These patch stimuli were orthogonal to the patch stimuli in the bright/dark patch condition on 40% of trials and only these trials were included as the neutral condition for behavioral analysis because the distance between the patch location and the central fixation spot was the same as that in the bright/dark condition. Participants were informed that these patch stimuli were task-irrelevant, and thus should be ignored. Trials were included for analysis if the two variable delay times both exceeded 2000 ms (times between target and patch stimulus appearance, and between patch stimulus appearance and FP disappearance, over 75% of trials). Stimulus location and patch condition (bright, dark, and neutral) were randomly interleaved, and there were 32 trials in the bright or dark condition. Memory-delay saccade task (Exp 1: Figure 1B). The identical configuration was used as in the visual-delay saccade task (165 trials) except that the target was briefly presented for 400 ms, and participants were required to generate a saccade towards the remembered location of the target only after the disappearance of FP. Similar to the visual-delay task, trials were included for analysis if the two variable delay times both exceeded 2000 ms (over 75% of trials), and participants had to remember the target location to perform the task accurately. Note that a previous study in humans has shown similar fMRI activation between memory-delay saccade and memory-delay recognition tasks (button press response), suggesting that the sustained activation in frontal and parietal areas during the memory delay period in the memory-delay saccade was more related to working memory rather than the planning of eye movements (Srimal and Curtis, 2008). Visual-delay and Memory-delay saccade task with no contingency between patch location and target location (Exp 2). We further performed a variant for the visual-delay saccade task and memory-delay saccade task (6 participants) in which the location of the patches were equally random relative to the location of the target (while the opposite spatial relationship between the two patch stimulus locations was maintained), with 8 possible locations (4 different radial angles at 45, 135, 225, and 315°, each at two eccentricities of 4 or 8° visual angle from the central fixation spot). As such, the three patch stimulus conditions (bright, dark, and neutral) made up 12.5%, 12.5%, and 75% of the 256 trials (25% for orthogonal patch) experiment respectively. We also performed a variant of the memory-delay saccade task with 16 possible target locations (512 trials, 4 participants) to verify that the results of the eight target location variant was not due to changes in subject strategy with the reduced number of target locations. The same results were obtained, and thus the 8 and 16 possible target memory-delay tasks were combined for data analysis. There were 32 trials in the bright or dark condition. After exclusion, there were at least 10 correct trials in each condition (bright and dark) for pupillary analysis from each participant. Data analysis. To maintain an accurate measure of pupil size, trials with an eye position deviation of more than 2° from the central FP or with detected saccades (>2°) during the required period of central fixation were excluded from analysis. When blinks were detected, following the literature, pre- and post-blink pupil values were used to perform a linear interpolation to replace pupil values during the blink period (Karatekin et al., 2010; Nassar et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). Trials were discarded when two blinks occurred within a time interval of less than 500 ms. The above criteria resulted in the removal of 8.8 and 9.0% of trials in the visual-delay and memory-delay task (Exp 1), respectively, and 2.2 and 3.1% of trials in the no contingency visual- and memory-delay task (Exp 2), respectively. Saccade reaction time (SRT) was defined as the time from the FP disappearance to the first saccade away from central fixation that exceeded 30°/s. Saccade direction deviation (angular degree) determined by saccade direction theta minus target direction theta was also reported. Failure to initiate a saccade within 1000 ms after the disappearance of FP or failure to make a saccade to the correct location (within 2.5° radius around the target) were marked as errors and were removed from pupillary analysis, consisting of 19.2 and 26.4% of trials in the visual-delay and memory-delay task (Exp 1), respectively (3.7 and 15.5% of trials removed in the no contingency visual- and memory-delay tasks- Exp 2). In Experiment 1, due to insufficient number of correct trials (<10 trials/condition) for analyses, one human participant was excluded in the visual-delay saccade task (N = 19), and three human participants were excluded in the memory-delay saccade task (N = 17). There were at least 10 correct trials in each condition (bright and dark) for included participants. Following the procedures of baseline-correction used previously (Wang et al., 2012, 2014), for each trial a baseline pupil value was determined by averaging pupil size from 200 ms before to 50 ms after the onset of the patch presentation because the human stimulus-evoked pupil response latency is regularly longer than 150 ms (Wang and Munoz, 2014; Wang et al., 2017). Pupil values were subtracted from this baseline value. The pupil diameter value was defined as the average pupil values during the time window of 200 to 800 ms that captures the pupillary changes evoked by the patch presentation. To specifically examine our hypothesis that pupillary responses evoked by patch stimuli should be smaller when the bright patch stimulus (compared to dark) was spatially aligned with the target location, we performed a one-sided t test on corresponding pupillary responses, except where indicated. Moreover, a Bayesian t test was performed to inform statistical significance for pairwise comparisons, with a scale factor r = 0.707 (Rouder et al., 2009). Note that the neutral condition was mainly used as catch trials to prevent subjects from developing a particular strategy during the tasks (e.g., expectation of the presentation of the patch stimuli at the saccade goal location or simply linking the patch locations to the target location). Therefore, the results from these trials were not of theoretical interests and not included for statistical analyses, except for behavioral data (only orthogonal patch stimulus condition) where a one way repeated-measure ANOVA was performed.",NA,All raw data is included in the Additional Files section.,NA,The additional files for this article can be found as follows: Supplementary Figure 1 Saccadic behaviors on the visual-delay task (Exp 1) in different patch conditions.

What Cross-morphemic Letter Transposition in Derived Nonwords Tells us about Lexical Processing,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.39,"According to an obligatory decomposition account of polymorphemic word recognition, a nonword that is composed of a real word plus derivational affix (e.g., teachen) should prime its stem (TEACH) to the same extent that a truly suffixed word does (e.g., teacher). The stem will be activated in both cases after the suffix is removed prior to the lexical status of the letter-string being of relevance. Importantly, disruption to the stem and suffix through letter transposition should have the same impact on the nonwords and words, with teacehn and teacehr equally priming TEACH. However, an experiment by Diependaele, Morris, Serota, Bertrand, and Grainger (2013) found that the equivalent priming for nonwords and words only occurred when they were intact. When letters were transposed, only the truly derived words showed priming. Since such a result cannot be handled by an obligatory decomposition account, it is important to replicate it. Therefore, the present study repeated the conditions of Diependaele et al. (2013), along with a nonword condition where the stem was followed by a non-suffix (e.g., teachin or teacihn). It was found that priming was maintained across all conditions regardless of letter transposition, hence maintaining obligatory decomposition as a viable account. However, the findings with the non-suffixed nonwords led to the conclusion that morphological structure does not control decomposition, but rather, has its impact after form-based components of the letter-string have been activated.","Reading, Visual word processing, Word processing",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.39/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.39/galley/78/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"The research reported in this paper was supported by a grant from the Australian Research Council (DP150100768), and a Research Fellowship from Macquarie University (MQRF).","There were 60 target words ranging in length from 4 to 9 letters (e.g., TEACH, EARTH, SEGMENT, GYMNAST) preceded by four different types of prime. In the Real Word condition, the prime was a word derived from the target by the addition of a two-letter suffix (e.g., teacher, earthen, segmental, gymnastic). In the Derived Nonword condition, the same set of suffixes was re-paired with a stem of the same length in such a way that a nonword was created (e.g., teachen, earther, segmentic, gymnastal). The third condition (Non-Derived Nonwords) was created by replacing the first letter of the suffix in the Derived Nonword condition to create a non-existing suffix (e.g., teachin, earthur, segmentoc, gymnastol). Finally, the SL Control condition was generated from the Derived Nonword condition by substituting the last letter of the stem and first letter of the suffix with two different letters, hence eliminating the whole target word from the beginning of the prime (teacsin, eartsir, segmenkoc, gymnaskol). The use of such a control condition would make it harder, if anything, to detect priming than the control condition adopted by Diependaele et al. (2013) where all letters differed between the prime and target. This should therefore make any evidence for priming all the more convincing in the current study. The complete set of items can be found in the Appendix. A Latin Square design was adopted whereby participants were assigned to one of four subgroups that received 15 of the targets under each of the priming conditions, but where no participant received the same target more than once. In addition to the 60 word targets preceded by their prime, there were 60 nonword targets each preceded by a prime that corresponded to one of the conditions used with the word targets. The target was always one or two letters different from the stem on which the prime was based. So, 15 of the items had a real word prime composed of a word with a two-letter derivational suffix (e.g., reviewer-REVIEN), 15 had a nonword prime also composed of a word with a two-letter suffix (e.g., preachen-PREATH), 15 had a nonword prime composed of a word with a two-letter non-suffix (e.g., directoc-DIRENT), and 15 had a nonword prime composed of a nonword created from a word by changing the final letter, followed by a two-letter non-suffix (e.g., shrungir-SPRUNK) where, like the SL Control condition, the target was one more letter different to the beginning of the prime than was the target in the other three conditions.",NA,The data can be found at osf.io/che7r in the form of a CSV file.,osf.io/che7r,The additional file for this article can be found as follows: Appendix List of experimental items.

Depressive Symptoms and Category Learning: A Preregistered Conceptual Replication Study,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.35,"We present a fully preregistered, high-powered conceptual replication of Experiment 1 by Smith, Tracy, and Murray (1993). They observed a cognitive deficit in people with elevated depressive symptoms in a task requiring flexible analytic processing and deliberate hypothesis testing, but no deficit in a task assumed to require more automatic, holistic processing. Specifically, they found that individuals with depressive symptoms showed impaired performance on a criterial-attribute classification task, requiring flexible analysis of the attributes and deliberate hypothesis testing, but not on a family-resemblance classification task, assumed to rely on holistic processing. While deficits in tasks requiring flexible hypothesis testing are commonly observed in people diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, these deficits are much less commonly observed in people with merely elevated depressive symptoms, and therefore Smith et al.’s (1993) finding deserves further scrutiny. We observed no deficit in performance on the criterial-attribute task in people with above average depressive symptoms. Rather, we found a similar difference in performance on the criterial-attribute versus family-resemblance task between people with high and low depressive symptoms. The absence of a deficit in people with elevated depressive symptoms is consistent with previous findings focusing on different tasks.","Categorization, Executive functions, Emotion and cognition",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.35/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.35/galley/74/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"This research was supported by a grant from the Research Fund of KU Leuven (GOA/15/003).

On the Automaticity of Familiarity in Short-term Recognition: A Test of the Dual-Process Assumption with the PRP Paradigm,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.21,"Dual-process models of recognition often assume that one retrieval process, generating a familiarity signal, is automatic, whereas the other, recollection, is controlled. Four experiments are presented to test for automaticity of familiarity in a short-term recognition task. The experiments use the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) paradigm to assess whether familiarity requires central processing capacity. Task 1 was an oral tone-classification task. Task 2 was a local-recognition task, in which participants decided whether a probe matched a particular item in the memory set, identified by its screen location. Intrusion probes, matching an item of the memory set in a different location, were slower and more difficult to reject than new probes. The size of this intrusion cost reflects the influence of familiarity on recognition. In all four experiments the size of the intrusion cost was additive with the stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) of Task 1 and Task 2, demonstrating that extraction of familiarity requires central capacity. In addition, Experiment 2 showed additive effects of memory set size and serial position with SOA, confirming that recollection, too, requires central capacity. Experiments 3A and 3B compared a condition including new probes to one including only positive and intrusion probes; in the latter condition the familiarity signal was completely uninformative. Participants showed some ability to reduce the influence of familiarity when it was completely uninformative, but only when they were explicitly told to do so (Experiment 3B). To conclude, by one criterion familiarity is a controlled process: It demands central processing capacity. It might also be controlled by another criterion: People can intentionally reduce the influence of familiarity on recognition decision, but they fail to do so spontaneously even when it would be advantageous.

Visual Selection: Usually Fast and Automatic; Seldom Slow and Volitional,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.13,"Recently it was argued that in addition to top-down and bottom-up processes, lingering biases of selection history play a major role in visual selection (Awh, Belopolsky & Theeuwes, 2012). Since its publication there has been a growing controversy about the terms top-down, bottom-up and selection-history in relation to visual selection. In the current paper we define these terms, discuss some controversies about these terms and explain what kind of effects should be considered to be the result of lingering biases of selection history, i.e., priming, reward/fear, and statistical learning. We discuss the properties of top-down selection (slow, effortful, and controlled) versus the properties of lingering biases of selection history (fast, effortless, and automatic). We adhere the position that the experience with selecting a particular feature or the location of a feature, may boost and sharpen its representation within the priority selection map above and beyond its physical salience. It is as if the experience may render a feature or location subjectively more salient. Our message of the current review is that true top-down control of visual selection occurs far less often than what is typically assumed. Most of the time, selection is based on experience and history. It is fast, automatic and occurs without much, if any, effort.","top-down and bottom-up control, attention, selection history",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.13/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.13/galley/64/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,The author has no data accessibility statement to declare.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1192,566
Pupil Dilation Reflects Task Relevance Prior to Search,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.12,"When observers search for a specific target, it is assumed that they activate a representation of the task relevant object in visual working memory (VWM). This representation – often referred to as the template – guides attention towards matching visual input. In two experiments we tested whether the pupil response can be used to differentiate stimuli that match the task-relevant template from irrelevant input. Observers memorized a target color to be searched for in a multi-color visual search display, presented after a delay period. In Experiment 1, one color appeared at the start of the trial, which was then automatically the search template. In Experiments 2, two colors were presented, and a retro-cue indicated which of these was relevant for the upcoming search task. Crucially, before the search display appeared, we briefly presented one colored probe stimulus. The probe could match either the relevant-template color, the non-cued color (irrelevant), or be a new color not presented in the trial. We measured the pupil response to the probe as a signature of task relevance. Experiment 1 showed significantly smaller pupil size in response to probes matching the search template than for irrelevant colors. Experiment 2 replicated the template matching effect and allowed us to rule out that it was solely due to repetition priming. Taken together, we show that the pupil responds selectively to participants’ target template prior to search.","pupil response, attentional priority, visual search, template, working memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.12/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.12/galley/25/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,"Data from the studies reported in this manuscript are publicly available on the Open Science Framework link: https://osf.io/dmfuv/, DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DMFUV","https://osf.io/dmfuv/, https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DMFUV",NA,NA,This work was supported by an ERC Consolidator grant ERC-2013-CoG-615423 to C.N.L.O.,NA,484,191
Simple and Complex Working Memory Tasks Allow Similar Benefits of Information Compression,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.31,"Complex working memory span tasks were designed to engage multiple aspects of working memory and impose interleaved processing demands that limit the use of mnemonic strategies, such as chunking. Consequently, the average span is usually lower (4 ± 1 items) than in simple span tasks (7 ± 2 items). One possible reason for the higher span of simple span tasks is that participants can take advantage of the spare time to chunk multiple items together to form fewer independent units, approximating 4 ± 1 chunks. It follows that the respective spans of these two types of tasks could be equal (at around 4 ± 1) if stimulus lists exclusively used nonchunkable stimulus items. To manipulate the chunkability of the stimulus lists, our method involved a measure of their compressibility, i.e., the extent to which a pattern exists that can be detected and used as a basis of chunk formation. We predicted an interaction between the types of tasks and chunkability/compressibility, supporting a single higher span for the condition in which a simple span task was combined with chunkable items. The three other conditions were predicted to prevent chunking processes, either because the interleaved processing task did not allow any chunking process to occur or because the noncompressible material inherently limited the chunkability of information. The prediction that chunking is important solely in simple spans was not confirmed: Effects of information compression contributed to performance levels to a similar extent in both tasks according to a theoretically-based metric. This result suggests that i) complex span tasks might overestimate storage capacity in general, and ii) the difference between simple and complex span performance levels must rest in some mechanism other than prevention of a chunking strategy by the interleaved processing task in complex span tasks.","Working memory, Short-term memory, Memory",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.31/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.31/galley/68/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,This research was supported in part by a grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR-17-CE28-0013-01) awarded to Fabien Mathy.,NA,NA,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1216986,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1216986,NA,NA,NA,NA,4778,524
Pupil Mimicry is the Result of Brightness Perception of the Iris and Pupil,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.34,"Recent scientific investigations suggest that people automatically mimic each other’s pupil sizes during interaction. However, instead of being a social mimicry effect, it could also be the result of brightness perception. When observers look at individuals with dilated pupils, little of the brighter iris is visible, leading to the perception of a relatively low-illuminated eye region. In the current study we tested whether pupil mimicry remains present when pupils and irises are equalized for luminance values across pupil sizes. We tested several stimulus sets, including faces with static pupils that varied in size across images and dynamic pupils that changed in size over time in videos. Results showed that for traditional, not-luminance-equalized videos, participants’ pupil sizes adapted to the observed pupils, showing a pattern that is roughly in line with pupil mimicry. However, no such pupil response in line with mimicry was seen for static images (regardless of whether they were equalized for luminance) nor for luminance-equalized videos. These findings suggest that only salient, dynamic stimuli attract enough attention to the luminance in the eye region to evoke a pupillary response. However, although such responses suggest pupil mimicry, the underlying factor is the change in brightness within the eye as a function of pupil size rather than social mimicry.","Pupil, Mimicry, Dilation, Visual Attention",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.34/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.34/galley/70/download/,NA,"We thank Mariska Kret for the initial collaboration, fruitful discussions, and help with the linear mixed-effects model.

Visual Awareness in Binocular Rivalry Modulates Induced Pupil Fluctuations,2018,Review article,1,1,10.5334/joc.16,"When a visual stimulus oscillates in luminance, pupil size follows this oscillation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that such induced pupil oscillations can be used to tag which stimulus is covertly attended. Here we ask whether this “pupil frequency tagging” approach can be extended to visual awareness, specifically to inferring perceptual dominance in Binocular Rivalry between complex stimuli. We presented two distinct stimuli, a face and a house, to each eye and modulated their luminance at 1.7 Hz either in counter-phase (180° phase shift), with a 90° phase shift or in phase (0° control). In some conditions, we additionally asked observers to attend either of the stimuli. The luminance modulation was sufficiently subtle that rivalry dynamics did not differ among these conditions, and was also indistinguishable from unmodulated presentation of the stimuli. For the 180° and the 90° phase-shifted stimuli, we found that the phase of the pupil response relative to the stimuli was modulated by perceptual dominance; that is, the relative phase depended on the stimulus the observer was aware of. In turn, this perceptually dominant stimulus could be decoded from the phase of the pupil response significantly above chance. Neither percept dependence of the phase nor significant decoding was found for the 0° control condition. Our results show that visual awareness modulates pupil responses and provide proof of principle that dominance in rivalry for complex stimuli can be inferred from induced pupil fluctuations.","Vision, Eye movements, Attention, Visual perception, Consciousness",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.16/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.16/galley/28/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,Data and code to replicate figures and analyses are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1006000.,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1006000,NA,NA,NA,NA,442,178
Can ‘Hebb’ Be Distracted? Testing the Susceptibility of Sequence Learning to Auditory Distraction,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.8,"Sequence learning plays a key role in many daily activities such as language and skills acquisition. The present study sought to assess the nature of the Hebb repetition effect—the enhanced serial recall for a repeated sequence of items compared to random sequences—by examining the vulnerability of this classical sequence-learning phenomenon to auditory distraction. Sound can cause unwanted distraction by either interfering specifically with the processes involved in the focal task (interference-by-process), or by diverting attention away from a focal task (attentional capture). Participants were asked to perform visual serial recall, in which one to-be-remembered sequence was repeated every four trials, while ignoring irrelevant sound. Whereas both changing-state (Experiment 1) and deviant sounds (Experiment 2) disrupted recall performance compared to steady-state sounds, performance for the repeated sequence increased across repetitions at the same rate regardless of the sound condition. Such findings suggest that Hebbian sequence learning is impervious to environmental interference, which provides further evidence that the Hebb repetition effect is an analogue of word-form learning.","Hebb repetition effect, Sequence learning, Auditory distraction, Serial memory, Irrelevant Sound, Word learning",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.8/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.8/galley/16/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,This work was supported by discovery grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) awarded to François Vachon and to Jean Saint-Aubin.

Working Memory Capacity as a Determinant of Proactive Interference and Auditory Distraction,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.7,"Individual differences in working memory capacity are related to performance on a range of elemental and higher order cognitive tasks. The current experiment tests the assumptions of two theoretical approaches to working memory capacity: working memory as executive attention and working memory as temporary binding. These approaches are examined using a short-term updating task where proactive interference is manipulated, such that old responses have to be suppressed in favour of new responses. A second source of distraction is introduced by way of irrelevant, to-be-ignored background speech that accompanies presentation of the list items. This speech reinforces either the to-be-remembered item on the current list, or the to-be-suppressed item. Working memory capacity was significantly related to overall level of correct performance on the short-term task, and to the degree of proactive interference experienced. However, there was no evidence for individual differences in the ability to suppress the interfering foil, nor in priming effects associated with the irrelevant speech. The results provided little support for the working memory capacity as executive attention perspective, some evidence for the binding perspective, but also evidence supporting the fact that some effects of distraction are not under voluntary control.","Working memory, Speech perception, Attention",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.7/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.7/galley/14/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,NA,"The materials and procedure used by Tolan and Tehan (2002) were utilised and are fully described in that paper. The cued recall component of the experiment consisted of 12 one-block trials and 40 two-block trials that were randomly ordered. The structure of the critical two block trials and the corresponding auditory distractors is presented in Figure 1. The critical two-block trials consisted of four words in the first block and five words in the second block. The two blocks were separated by an exclamation point (!) and the category cue presented in capital letters followed the end of the second block prompting recall. On all trials a single target item (in Figure 1 cat) was presented among fillers in the most recent block. Proactive interference was manipulated on 20 trials by including a second item (foil – dog) from the same category as the target in the first block. An example of an interference trial would be: house, apple, dog, watch ! tree, cloud, cat, book, nail ANIMAL. The other 20 trials were no-interference trials, in which the foil was replaced with a filler (pen). There are three measures of performance on this task: correct recall of the target, omissions where the target is not recalled (and nor is the foil), and false recall of the foil that appeared in the first block. Data from our lab indicates that twenty minute test-retest reliability estimates for the three measures are .65, .65 and .50 for target, omissions and lures, respectively. Figure 1 Structure of a standard trial with to-be-remembered items in the centre column, and irrelevant speech conditions on the outsice columns. All the cued recall trials were studied in the presence of background speech. The irrelevant speech consisted of a string of 18 words, five of which shared phonological features with either the target or the foil. These five items were presented in positions 12 to 16 in the irrelevant stream. Two of the five key irrelevant speech items shared the same stem as the foil or target, two shared the same rhyme ending and one shared the same consonants. An example of the critical irrelevant speech items supporting the target word, cat, were cab, hat, cot, can, and mat. The irrelevant speech supported the foil on 10 of the interference trials and on 10 of the no-interference trials (although the foil was not actually present for these no-interference trials). Similarly, the speech supported the target on 10 of the interference trials and 10 of the no-interference trials. The individual difference manipulation consisted of a modified operation span task in which words and math problems [e.g., (3 × 4) – 1 = 10] were presented in pairs. Participants read the word (and attempt to remember it) and then processed the mathematics problem. After all pairs were presented participants attempted to recall the words in the order in which they were presented. The current procedure deviated from the standard span methodology in that each trial consisted of four word/maths problems (fixed list length), and there were eight trials in total. Unpublished research from our laboratory has indicated that eight fixed-length trials of four words produces the same level of reliability as a 20-trial, span procedure starting with four trials at two words and finishing with four trials of six words. The twenty-minute test-retest reliability estimates were .79 and .87 for the maths and memory component respectively.",NA,Data for this experiment is available for inspection at https://osf.io/tdyxp/.,https://osf.io/tdyxp/,NA,NA,NA,NA,420,130
Further Tests of the Utility of Integrated Speed-Accuracy Measures in Task Switching,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.6,"Speed and accuracy of performance are central to many theoretical accounts of cognitive processing. In recent years, several integrated performance measures have been proposed. A comparative study of the available measures [Vandierendonck, A. (2017).

DOI: https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0721-5] concluded that three of the measures, namely inverse efficiency score, rate correct score, and linear integrated speed-accuracy score achieved a balanced integration of speed and accuracy. As a follow-up on that study, these three measures were examined in data analyses from 13 (published and unpublished) experiments in the context of task switching. The correlations of the effect sizes in these integrated scores with the effect sizes obtained in latency and accuracy were high, but varied across the three integrated measures. The efficiency to detect effects supported by the speed and accuracy data was examined by means of signal detection analyses. The three measures efficiently detected effects present in either speed or accuracy, but the rate correct score was less efficient than the other two measures and it signalled a larger number of strong effects unsupported by the speed and accuracy data. It is concluded that while the rate correct score is better avoided, and the usage of the inverse efficiency score should be restricted to data with low overall error rates, the linear integrated speed-accuracy score proves to be valid.","integrated speed-accuracy scoring, task switching",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.6/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.6/galley/18/download/,The author has no competing interests to declare.,NA,NA,NA,The data used in the present article are accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.962308 for data set 1 and at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.963227 for data set 2.,"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.962308, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.963227",NA,NA,NA,NA,910,257
Taking the Book from the Bookshelf: Masked Constituent Priming Effects from Compound Words and Nonwords,2018,Research article,1,1,10.5334/joc.11,"Recent evidence from visual word recognition points to the important role of embedded words, suggesting that embedded words are activated independently of whether they are accompanied by an affix or a non-affix. The goal of the present research was to more closely examine the mechanisms involved in embedded word activation, particularly with respect to the “edge-alignedness” of the embedded word. We conducted two experiments that used masked priming in combination with lexical decision. In Experiment 1, monomorphemic target words were either preceded by a compound word prime (e.g., textbook-BOOK/textbook-TEXT), a compound-nonword prime (e.g., pilebook-BOOK/textpile-TEXT), a non-compound nonword prime (e.g., pimebook-BOOK/textpime-TEXT) or an unrelated prime (e.g., textjail-BOOK/jailbook-TEXT). The results revealed significant priming effects, not only in the compound word and compound-nonword conditions, but also in the non-compound nonword condition, suggesting that embedded words (e.g., book) were activated independently of whether they occurred in combination with a real morpheme (e.g., pilebook) or a non-morphemic constituent (e.g., pimebook). Priming in the compound word condition was greater than in the two nonword conditions, indicating that participants benefited from the whole-word representation of real compound words. Constituent priming occurred independently of whether the target word was the first or the second embedded constituent of the prime (e.g., textbook-BOOK vs. textbook-TEXT). In Experiment 2, significant priming effects were found for edge-aligned embedded constituents (e.g., pimebook-BOOK), but not for mid-embedded (e.g., pibookme-BOOK) or the outer-embedded constituents (e.g., bopimeok-BOOK), suggesting that edge-alignedness is a key factor determining the activation of embedded words.","compound word processing, embedded words, masked priming, lexical decision",https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.11/,https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.11/galley/23/download/,The authors have no competing interests to declare.,"This research was supported by the Brain and Language Research Institute (BLRI, ANR-11-LABX-0036) and the Institute of Convergence ILCB (ANR-16-CONV-0002).

All compound-constituents were either nouns, verbs or adjectives (we excluded anybody) and always mono-morphemic (we excluded glassmaking, as well as pseudo-affixed constituents such as the butter of buttermilk and the body of bodyguard). Compound words were always transparent (e.g., we excluded partially opaque compounds like keyboard, where the most frequent usage of key is door-key). The compound’s second constituent never appeared as a first constituent (since we used textbook, we excluded bookshelf). Based on the compound words, we created two stimulus sets (Appendix A). In Set 1, compound primes were paired with a target that was the compound’s second constituent (textbook-BOOK). In Set 2, compound primes were paired with a target that was the compound’s first constituent (textbook-TEXT). Compound word primes were nearly identical in Sets 1 and 2, except that 5 compound words had to be replaced in Set 2 to avoid target repetition. Target words of Sets 1 and 2 were matched on word frequency, length and orthographic neighborhood (descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1).

In Set 1, compound-nonwords were created by replacing the first constituent of the compound word with a novel word constituent (pilebook-BOOK), non-compounds by replacing 1–2 letters within the first constituent of the compound word (pimebook-BOOK), and unrelated nonwords were created by replacing the second constituent of the compound prime with an orthographically unrelated mono-morphemic constituent (textjail-BOOK). In Set 2, primes were created by replacing the second constituents, using the same principles as in Set 1 (textpile-TEXT/textpime-TEXT/jailbook-TEXT). Constituents of compound words and compound-nonwords were of the exact same length (textbook vs. pilebook). Constituents of compound-nonword primes were selected such that they never occurred in first or second constituent position in real compound primes. Constituents of compound words and compound nonwords were matched on frequency, number of letters, number of phonemes, number of syllables, orthographic neighborhood, and phonological neighbourhood (see Table 1). All item specific variables were retrieved from the LEXIQUE database (New, Pallier, Brysbaert, & Ferrand, 2004). For the purpose of the lexical decision task, we included 52 nonword targets (NESH, NUNE, etc.), which were orthographically legal and pronounceable and matched on length to the real-word targets. Each nonword target was preceded by four different primes, which were structured in the same way as the primes preceding the word targets. In Set 1, primes were created by replacing the second constituents of the compound word, compound-nonwords, and non-compound conditions with the nonword target (textnesh-NESH/pilenesh-NESH/pimenesh-NESH), compared to an unrelated control (textbrav-NESH). In Set 2, primes were created by replacing the first constituents (nunebook-NUNE/nunepile-NUNE/nunepime-NUNE/wostbook-NUNE).
